I want to view the status of one of the domains associated with the mobility module. How can I do this?

The easiest way to do this is to log in to the web console and from the dashboard choose `Domains` from the Statistical Breakdown by drop-down list box. This shows the active and delayed queues for all domains. Next, click the specific domain you are interested in. You can also choose to view Transfailures or Bounces by selecting the appropriate tab. For more information see [The Dashboard](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-ref/web3.dashboard). Also, from the command line you can go to the system console and issue the command, **showqueue *`domain_name.com`***                    .

Is it possible to add new domain stanzas without restarting Momentum?

Yes. The easiest way to do this is by using the web UI. For more information see [Using the Web Console](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-ref/web3).
