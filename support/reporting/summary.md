The Summary Report will load with a default time range of the last hour. For large senders, there may be a short delay while the data is being compiled. The Calendar drop down provides preset time ranges and an optional custom date/time picker. You can also apply additional search criteria like recipient domain, campaign or template name in the search bar in the upper right.
