### Reporting Period

The report gives details of the previous 7 days sending on your account along with similar details from the 7 days before that for comparison.

## Account Health Metrics 

The health metrics shown in the report are important because SparkPost uses them to assess sending reputation. In extreme cases, SparkPost may warn you or even suspend your account based on these metrics. The report will colour poor health metrics to highlight any issues.

### Hard Bounce Rate

Your _hard bounce rate_ is the percentage of your messages that resulted in delivery failures known as "hard bounces". You can read details about how SparkPost classifies the various types of delivery failure in [this article](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/deliverability/bounce-classification-codes/).

### Spam Complaint Rate

Your _spam complaint rate_ is the percentage of your messages that result in spam complaints from your recipients.

### Health Metric Rankings

The report may show a _rank_ value for each health metric. This section gives your account's position or "rank" for that metric compared to all other SparkPost accounts. For instance, if your hard bounce rate rank says "Top 10th percentile", then your hard bounce rate is in the top 10% of senders using SparkPost. That is a nice place to be.
