SparkPost accounts have a daily and monthly sending limits that control number of emails you can send within each time period. These limits protect your account from unexpectedly high ovarge billing and are based on your plan level.

You can view your current limits on the [Usage](http://app.sparkpost.com/usage)([EU](http://app.eu.sparkpost.com/usage)) page.

 ### Daily Limits

The daily limit controls the number of messages that can be sent during a rolling 24 hour period. For example, if you reached your daily limit at 3:05 pm yesterday, you will be able to send again after 3:05 pm today.

You can request an increase to your daily limit from your [Dashboard](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard?supportTicket=true)([EU](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard?supportTicket=true)). All limit requests are reviewed based upon your account's sending performance and history with SparkPost. Free Test accounts are not permitted increase their daily limit.

### Monthly Limits and Overages

If you are on any of our currently-offered paid plans, you can exceed your monthly plan volume up to your monthly limit and you will be charged for the additional usage at your plan's overage rate. Free Test accounts are not permitted to go over the monthly plan volume.

### What happens if I exceed a quota?

If you exceed your limit, whether Daily or Monthly, your messages will be rejected by SparkPost (not queued), so please ensure your account has the appropriate limit needed for your sending pattern, or consider splitting your send to accommodate the limits.

### I have just upgraded and my daily limit hasn't changed!

Daily limits can take up to 6 days to fully update after you upgrade your plan. If your account is new, please start sending within the limit so we can better undertand your needs. If your new limit is too low after this period, you can request an increase to your daily limit from your [Dashboard](http://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard)([EU](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard?supportTicket=true)). All limit requests are reviewed based upon your account's sending performance and history with SparkPost.

### I need a bigger daily limit

If you need to send more than 50,000 email a day on average throughout a calendar month, SparkPost requires that you have one or more dedicated IPs and custom bounce and tracking domains set up. Please set these up before requesting a limit rise.

**Note:**  Please follow our [IP Warm up Guide](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/deliverability/ip-warm-up-overview/) to warm up any new IP and correctly establish your sending reputation.
