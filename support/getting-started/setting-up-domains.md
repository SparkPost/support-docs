The following are instructions for creating sending domains via the SparkPost app.

1. In the SparkPost app, navigate to **Configuration** > **Sending Domains**.
1. Type your sending domain in the box, and then choose your subaccount options for the sending domain. For more information on subaccounts, please see [this support article](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/user-guide/subaccounts/). Click "Add Domain" when you are finished.

1. The next screen will display your newly created domain, but a red "Unverified" status will show in the upper right box. A sending domain must be verified before it can be used on SparkPost. In order to verify the domain, you must place the DKIM TXT record displayed in the _Set Up For Sending_ section into DNS.

1. Depending on what domain provider you are using, their DNS may look different, but how it works is essentially the same across all providers. There will be a TEXT field, and you can put the DKIM record in the text fields. We have provided you with many domain provider’s steps to go through to put your DKIM record into their records [here](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-sparkpost/#prerequisites).

1. To add the DKIM record to your DNS, first copy the "Hostname" portion provided in the _Set Up For Sending_ section of the SparkPost app and paste it in the "Host" section of your DNS TXT record. This value should be similar to `scphxxxx._domainkey.yourdomain.xxx`. Please note that some providers are particular about the "Host" and may require that the value be added as just `scphxxxx._domainkey`.

1. Next copy the "Value" portion provided in the _Set Up For Sending_ section of the SparkPost app and paste it in the "Value" section of your DNS TXT record. Please note that even though the value (or domain key) looks long, do not break it into 2 or more lines or make any changes to the key. It may not look like DNS can handle all of the characters, but it can.

1. It can take a bit of time for DKIM records to propagate. You can check the TTL (time to live) amount within your DNS provider – usually they are beside the record type. It can take up to that time both to be propagated and ready to go. Once they do, you may click the orange "Verify TXT Record" in the app. If the domain validates successfully, this is what it should look like:

*Note:* that if you ever remove your domain from your SparkPost Account and re-add it, this will reset the TXT record for the domain in SparkPost, so you will need to update your DNS TXT record to verify the domain.
