## Heading

Here is a list of examples for how to use headings

# <a name="h1"></a> h1

## <a name="h2"></a> h2

### <a name="h3"></a> h3

#### <a name="h4"></a> h4

##### <a name="h5"></a> h5

###### <a name="h6"></a> h6

To predict the ID for the heading use [this tool](https://codepen.io/avrahamgoldman/full/XRZxrz).

This is a block of text. You can do things like **bold** and _italic_.

### Lists

This is a bulleted list of stuff:

- Item one
- Second item
- Item number three
- A fourth item

This is an ordered list:

1. Item one
1. Second item
1. Item number three
1. A fourth item

### Quotes

> This is a block quote. Use these for quoting another source.
>
> They can span multiple lines.

## Links

You can link to external resources using this format: `[text here](link here)`. For example:

- [SparkPost website](https://www.sparkpost.com)
- [SparkPost API docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api)

### Images

Here's an image (put those in the `media` folder for the category):

### Code

You can do inline `code like this`.

Or a nice little multi-line code block:

```
You can put anything in here. But if you want to do real code snippets with syntax highlighting, read on...
```

You can get syntax highlighting by specifying a language, like JSON:

```json
{
  "something": "value",
  "anotherThing": "anotherValue"
}
```

Or in this case, Python:

```python
def do_something():
    print("Hello there!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    do_something()
```
