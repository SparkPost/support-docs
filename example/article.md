## Heading

This is a block of text. You can do things like **bold** and *italic*.

### Lists

This is a bulleted list of stuff:

* Item one
* Second item
* Item number three
* A fourth item

This is an ordered list:

1. Item one
1. Second item
1. Item number three
1. A fourth item

### Quotes

> This is a block quote. Use these for quoting another source.
>
> They can span multiple lines.

## Links

You can link to external resources using this format: `[text here](link here)`. For example:

* [SparkPost website](https://www.sparkpost.com)
* [SparkPost API docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api)

### Images

Here's an image (put those in the `media` folder for the category):

![Alternative text here](media/example.png)

### Code

You can do inline `code like this`.

Or a nice little multi-line code block:

```
You can put anything in here. But if you want to do real code snippets with syntax highlighting, read on...
```

You can get syntax highlighting by specifying a language, like JSON:

```json
{
  "something": "value",
  "anotherThing": "anotherValue"
}
```

Or in this case, Python:

```python
def do_something():
    print("Hello there!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    do_something()
```
