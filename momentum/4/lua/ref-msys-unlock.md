## Description

Releases a lock obtained via msys.lock. **This function must be called from the same OS level thread that obtained it.** 

For example code see [thread.mutex](lua.ref.thread.mutex "thread.mutex").

Because this function is in the `msys` namespace, an explicit `require` is not necessary.
