---

The `eccluster.conf` file configures the behavior of the Momentum Cluster Manager [eccmgr](executable.eccmgr "eccmgr"). Note that it does not configure the behavior of cluster nodes. This file is found in the `/opt/msys/ecelerity/etc/conf/default/` directory.

The following is an example `eccluster.conf` file:

<a name="conf.ref.eccluster.conf.example"></a> 

**Example 16.1. eccluster.conf file**

```
# Security stanza 
Security {
  user = "ecuser"
  group = "ecuser"
}

# Logs stanza
Logs {
  logfile = "/var/log/eccluster/%Y/%m/%d/%{l}/%{s}/%{n}"
  file_mode = "0640"
  dir_mode = "0755"
}

# Control_Listener stanza
Control_Listener {
  AuthDigestMD5Parameters = [
    uri = "ecauth://"
  ]
  Enable_Authentication = "true"

  Enable_Authorization = "false"
  AuthorizationParameters = [
    uri = "ecauth://"
  ]

  Listen "/tmp/2025" {
    Enable_Authentication = "false"
  }
  Listen "127.0.0.1:2025" {
  }
}

# Cluster Manager event logging
# troubleshoot the eccmgr instance by looking for its logs
# in /var/log/eccluster/paniclog.ec
ec_logger "ec_logger"
{
  rejectlog = "/var/log/eccluster/rejectlog.ec"
  mainlog = "/var/log/eccluster/mainlog.ec"
  heartbeat = "0"
  paniclog = "/var/log/eccluster/paniclog.ec"
#  acctlog = "/var/log/eccluster/acctlog.ec"
}

# Include auxillary information prepared by the installer; this must be the
# last thing in the top level eccluster.conf file
readonly_include "/opt/msys/etc/installer/eccmgr.d/ecdb.conf"
```

Using the console from the cluster manager, you can view the contents of the `eccluster.conf` file. For instance, if your configuration matches the example above, the output of **config show Logs**           is as follows:

```
/tmp/2025> config show Logs
dir_mode = "0755"
logfile = "/var/log/eccluster/%Y/%m/%d/%{l}/%{s}/%{n}"
file_mode = "0640"
```

Since the `eccluster.conf` file is specific to the cluster manager, you cannot view the `Logs` scope from the console on a cluster node.

For a discussion of scopes and fallbacks, see [Section 15.3, “Configuration Scopes and Fallback”](ecelerity.conf.fallback "15.3. Configuration Scopes and Fallback").

For a summary of all the non-module specific configuration options, refer to [Chapter 66, *Configuration Options Summary*](config.options.summary "Chapter 66. Configuration Options Summary") .

Modules and their configuration options are discussed in the [Chapter 71, *Modules Reference*](modules "Chapter 71. Modules Reference") .

The following sections provide an overview of the configuration commonly defined in the `eccluster.conf` file.

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>Security</dt>

<dd>

For a discussion of the `Security` stanza options, see [security](conf.ref.security "security").

</dd>

<dt>Control_Listener</dt>

<dd>

The `Control_Listener` stanza, specifies the port on which `eccmgr` listens. On Unix systems, `eccmgr` listens at `/tmp/2025` by default. For a discussion of the Control_Listener, see [Chapter 17, *Configuring Momentum's System Console*](control_listener "Chapter 17. Configuring Momentum's System Console") .

</dd>

<dt>Cluster Manager Event Logging</dt>

<dd>

For a discussion of using the ec_logger module on the cluster manager, see [Section 71.30.3, “Configuration for the Cluster Manager”](modules.ec_logger#modules.ec_logger.eccmgr "71.30.3. Configuration for the Cluster Manager").

For a discussion of using the bounce_logger module on the cluster manager, see [Section 71.13.3, “Configuration for the Cluster Manager”](modules.bounce_logger#modules.bounce_logger.eccmgr "71.13.3. Configuration for the Cluster Manager").

</dd>

<dt><a name="conf.ref.eccluster.conf.logs"></a> Log Aggregation</dt>

<dd>

The `Logs` scope must be configured in order to aggregate node logs on the log aggregator. The following is the default configuration in the `eccluster.conf` file:

<a name="conf.ref.eccluster.conf.logs.stanza"></a> 

**Example 16.2. Logs Stanza**

```
Logs {
  logfile = "/var/log/eccluster/%Y/%m/%d/%{l}/%{s}/%{n}"
  file_mode = "0640"
  dir_mode = "0755"
}
```

The following options are valid in the `Logs` scope.

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt><a name="eccluster.conf.logs.control_cache"></a> Control_Cache</dt>

<dd>

Name of the cache file storing asynchronous responses to clusterwide Momentum inquiries

</dd>

<dt><a name="eccluster.conf.logs.dir_mode"></a> Dir_Mode</dt>

<dd>

Octal representation of the file permissions of newly created log directories

</dd>

<dt><a name="eccluster.conf.logs.file_mode"></a> File_Mode</dt>

<dd>

Octal representation of the file permissions of newly created log files

</dd>

<dt><a name="eccluster.conf.logs.logfile"></a> Logfile</dt>

<dd>

Defines the full pathname of the log file to be written.

As `eccmgr` is capable of writing log files into several distinct locations, a simple interpolation set is provided. All of the POSIX strftime macros are supported (see the POSIX strftime standard), as well as two special interpolations. %{n} will interpolate to the name of the cluster node that generated the log line in question. %{l} will interpolate to the name of the log as named in the logs section of the cluster configuration in the `ecelerity.conf`. For more information about the POSIX strftime macros, see [strftime](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strftime.html).

There is no restriction on the value assigned to this option as long as it creates a valid path after all the macros get expanded; it does not have to exist beforehand, `eccmgr` will create directories as needed, hence the `Dir_Mode`.

</dd>

<dt><a name="eccluster.conf.logs.max_idle"></a> Max_Idle</dt>

<dd>

Maximum number of seconds a log file may be left open without writing a new log entry to it

</dd>

<dt><a name="eccluster.conf.logs.max_open"></a> Max_Open</dt>

<dd>

Maximum number of concurrently open log files

</dd>

</dl>

The example configuration, [Example 16.2, “Logs Stanza”](conf.ref.eccluster.conf#conf.ref.eccluster.conf.logs.stanza "Example 16.2. Logs Stanza"), creates logs under `/var/log/eccluster` according to the `logfile` setting. This is processed by `strftime` expanding the macros as follows:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>%Y</dt>

<dd>

Four digit representation of the year

</dd>

<dt>%m</dt>

<dd>

Two digit representation of the month

</dd>

<dt>%d</dt>

<dd>

Two digit representation of the day of the month

</dd>

</dl>

Additional special place holders are as follows:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>%{l}</dt>

<dd>

Expands to the name of the log specified as the key in the `logs` dictionary configured within the cluster scope of the `ecelerity-cluster.conf` file. See [logs](modules.cluster#option.logs.dictionary)

</dd>

<dt>%{n}</dt>

<dd>

Expands to the name of the node

</dd>

<dt>%{s}</dt>

<dd>

Expands to the name of the subcluster to which the node belongs

</dd>

</dl>

For example, the mainlog, being pulled from `node1`, where `node1` is a member of the subcluster named `mycluster`, the data would be logged to: /var/log/eccluster*`/year/month/day/`*mainlog/mycluster/node1.

In addition to the place holders shown above, all of the POSIX `strftime` macros are supported. For more information, see [strftime](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strftime.html).

There are no requirements regarding the structure of the filenames, nor is there any expectation that you have configured centralized logging, so you are free to adjust the `logfile` parameter to suit your needs as long as `logfile` defines a valid path after all the macros get expanded. The path does not have to exist beforehand, `eccmgr` will create directories as needed.

</dd>

<dt>Included Files</dt>

<dd>

The `/opt/msys/etc/installer/eccmgr.d/ecdb.conf` file contains the definition of the `ecdb` datasource file.

</dd>

<dt>as_logger Module</dt>

<dd>

The [as_logger](modules.as_logger "71.7. as_logger – Audit Series Logger") module is specific to the cluster manager. It must be manually added to the `eccluster.conf` file, if needed.

</dd>
