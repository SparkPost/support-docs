The `bouncelog` records both in-band and out-of-band bounces. It is configured in the [bounce_logger](modules.bounce_logger "71.13. bounce_logger – Momentum-Style Bounce Logging") module.

### <a name="idp4696736"></a> 35.3.1. Bounce Records

A bounce line is written to the `bouncelog` for every bounce that Momentum witnesses. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

```
1064868656@91/6D-07914-E67BC044@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@B@ »

### <a name="idp4738368"></a> 35.3.2. Heartbeat Records

In addition to the record described in the previous section, a heartbeat is written periodically to the log, indicating that Momentum is still active and may log further data. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

`1251222268@@@@M1`

The following is a description of the fields:

<a name="log_formats.heartbeat.bounce.fields"></a> 

**Table 35.5. Heartbeat record fields**

| Offset | Example Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1251222268 | Date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970) |
| 1 |   | Unused |
| 2 |   | Unused |
| 3 |   | Unused |
| 4 | M1 | `M1` indicating a heartbeat |

Having three unused fields ensures that, like other logs, the fifth field is the log entry type. This makes parsing easier.
