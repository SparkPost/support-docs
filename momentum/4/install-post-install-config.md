During installation, configuration files with reasonable defaults are added to the local copy of the configuration repository. Message Systems recommends you review the files found in `/opt/msys/ecelerity/etc/conf` before using Momentum in a production environment. For information about the configuration files, see [Chapter 66, *Configuration Options Summary*](config.options.summary "Chapter 66. Configuration Options Summary") .

### Note

In a cluster environment, you can make configuration changes on any Platform node. Once changes have been added to the repository, Momentum will update all nodes.
