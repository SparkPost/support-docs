Momentum’s logging capabilities are implemented by various modules. They are intended to maintain auditing and a history of events, providing information such as system errors, message disposition, and engagement tracking. The logging subsystems range from transactional logs on a server node to replicated server node logs, aggregated on the designated log aggregator.

The following are Momentum's logging modules. For additional information about use and configuration, follow each link :

*   [adaptive](modules.adaptive#modules.adaptive.options.logging "71.3.8. Logging") - logs adaptive delivery events

*   [as_logger](modules.as_logger "71.7. as_logger – Audit Series Logger") - journals replicated audit series to disk at a configurable, periodic interval

*   [chunk_logger](modules.chunk_logger "71.15. chunk_logger Module") - provides a safe interface for logging asynchronously from Lua, C, and C++

*   [custom_logger](modules.custom_logger "71.25. custom_logger – User-defined Logging") - enables you to create custom logs defining your own logging fields and delimiters

*   [ec_logger](modules.ec_logger "71.30. EC_logger – Momentum-Style Logging") - provides message disposition status, tracking messages from generation through delivery

*   [event_hydrant](modules.event_hydrant "71.33. event_hydrant – Message Tracking") - provides message disposition status, including message generation, message reception, message delivery, and engagement tracking

*   [exim_logger](modules.exim_logger "71.34. exim_logger – Exim Logging") - supports logging in the same style as the Open Source MTA Exim (http://www.exim.org)

Momentum can generate logs in two formats:

*   text - entries vary based on the type of log. For the log formats, see [Chapter 35, *Log Formats*](log_formats "Chapter 35. Log Formats") .

*   [jlog](modules.jlog "71.43. jlog – jlog-Formatted Logging") - binary, consumable logs, intended to be consumed by an application. These logs will continue to be saved until a consumer reads them.
