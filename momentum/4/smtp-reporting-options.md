For every message injected, Momentum reports data tracking its full disposition status. You can view this reporting data using the following:

*   Web-based User Interface – Using this flexible, easy-to-use interface, you can evaluate your message deliverability and track engagement. See the tutorial in [Chapter 56, *Using the UI for Reporting*](reporting_ui "Chapter 56. Using the UI for Reporting") .

*   Metrics API – Using the [Metrics API](/web-rest/v1_index.html/v-1-index-html), you can retrieve statistical, real-time data about message processing, message disposition, and campaign performance. See the tutorial in [Chapter 58, *Using the Metrics API for Reporting*](reporting_metrics "Chapter 58. Using the Metrics API for Reporting") .

*   Webhooks – Using the [Webhooks API](/web-rest/v1_index.html/v-1-index-html) or the Webhooks page of the UI, you can receive push updates of the raw events generated by Momentum. See the tutorial in [Chapter 59, *Using Webhooks for Event Data*](reporting_webhooks "Chapter 59. Using Webhooks for Event Data") .

*   jlog files – Using the configuration options in the event_hydrant module, you can direct event data to jlog files. See [Section 71.33, “event_hydrant – Message Tracking”](modules.event_hydrant "71.33. event_hydrant – Message Tracking").
