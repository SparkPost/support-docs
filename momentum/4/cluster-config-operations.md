**eccmgr** is the Momentum Cluster Manager, henceforth referred to as the cluster manager. On start up, the script **/etc/init.d/eccmgr start**       runs **eccmgr** as a service on the node designated as Manager. For details about the available options, see [eccmgr](executable.eccmgr "eccmgr").

Use **eccmgr_ctl** to start, stop, or restart this service. For details about this command, see [eccmgr_ctl](executable.eccmgr_ctl "eccmgr_ctl").

## <a name="idp4323200"></a> 38.1. Connecting to the Console on the Cluster Manager

When **eccmgr** is running, you can log in to the console as you would any other node - by issuing the command:

`/opt/msys/ecelerity/bin/ec_console`

A successful connection will result in output similar to the following:

```
##############################################
# eccmgr version: 3.0.10.30753 r(30754)
# Copyright (c) 1999-2009 Message Systems, Inc.
# All Rights Reserved.
##############################################
12:33:15 /tmp/2025>
```

For information about the console, see [`ec_console`](operations#operations.console "37.1. Connecting to the Console").

On Unix systems, **eccmgr** listens at `/tmp/2025` by default. If you should need to change this default, you must edit the `Control_Listener` stanza in [`eccluster.conf`](conf.ref.eccluster.conf "16.2. eccluster.conf File") and perhaps also your [`/opt/msys/ecelerity/etc/environment`](environment_file "Chapter 31. Configuring the Environment File") file.

When you are logged into the console of the cluster manager, you can use any of the commands listed in [Section 38.2, “Console Commands for the Cluster Manager”](cluster.config.operations.eccmgr.console "38.2. Console Commands for the Cluster Manager")

### Note

The cluster *module* belongs to the configuration of a node. For this reason, the console commands specific to the cluster *module* can only be issued from that node and not from within the **eccmgr** service. For a list of these commands, see [Section 71.19.4, “Cluster Module-specific Console Commands”](modules.cluster#modules.cluster.console "71.19.4. Cluster Module-specific Console Commands").
