If you have received an email from abuse@sparkpost.com, and sent your reply but never heard back, it could be because the email wasn't received for some reason.

If this happens, and you haven't heard back within 48 hours, please click on the link and fill out the Support [form](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/emails/new).
