When you're submitting a Support ticket or communicating with us via our [community Slack channel](http://slack.sparkpost.com), we ask you to identify your account by providing either your Username, Account ID (Customer ID), or Email Address used to create the SparkPost account. Having this info allows us to help you faster, especially if you are sending us an email from an address not associated with your account.

To find this info, log into your SparkPost account, go to Account, then Profile; you will find your Username, Account ID (Customer ID) and Email Address info at the top of that page. 

For **SparkPost Enterprise customers**, please provide your email address in the "SparkPost Username, Account ID or Email” field.
