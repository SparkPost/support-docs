When send messages using the SparkPost REST API, the message body can be specified either "inline" as part of the transmission request or by referring to a stored template.  When using an inline template, you can specify attachments to include in the final message through the content.attachments attribute.  However, when using a stored template, the content.attachments attribute is not available.

If you have a *fixed* attachment to include within a stored template, you can embed it within the template by populating the template's email_rfc822 attribute with a preformed multipart message. In this context, a fixed attachment is one which is the same for all deliveries and recipients.

For more details on using the template email_rfc822 attribute, check out [the templates API reference](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/templates) and [this blog post on advanced template usage](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/advanced-email-templates/).
