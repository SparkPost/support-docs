Mandrill users coming to SparkPost often have a volume of email templates. Mandrill's Handlebars template syntax is different to SparkPost's own syntax so it could be time consuming and error prone to translate each template by hand.

The Mandrill template migration tool provides a way to simplify this task. Its available [here on GitHub](http://github.com/SparkPost/mandrill-sparkpost-templates/) and has both a UI-driven migration path and an API for automatic migration.

For more details on how to use the tool, you could [read our blog post on the topic](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/mandrill-template-migration-tool-mst3k/).
