The SparkPost webhooks interface allows you to push web hook events of your choice to your own endpoint for processing.  You can also retrieve event level data through the [Message Events API](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/message-events).

There are three (3) main categories of webhook events in SparkPost:

1.  Message Events: Describe the lifecycle of a message (transmission), including: injection, delivery, and disposition
2.  Generation Events: Provide insight into message creation failures or rejections (by SparkPost)
3.  Engagement Events: Describe what recipients "do" with your email, such as: opens (renders) and clicks

Each of the above categories have a variety of event types, each with a unique set of fields that will provide information to your webhook event consumer. Read the full list of [event-to-field mappings in SparkPost webhooks](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/webhooks).
