If you need an example of the format for your CSV file, select a sample to download by selecting "Download a recipient list CSV template".

You may upload tags and additional information for a given recipient if required - but it is not essential. A list of correctly formatted email addresses is also acceptable. You can also edit an existing recipient list by uploading a new file to an existing label (list name).

**Note:** The maximum supported size of a recipient list .csv file is **2GB**.

## Editing an Existing Recipient List

* Click on the Label you want to update
