If you need an example of the format for your CSV file, select a sample to download by selecting "Download a recipient list CSV template".

You may upload tags and additional information for a given recipient if required - but it is not essential. A list of correctly formatted email addresses is also acceptable. You can also edit an existing recipient list by uploading a new file to an existing label (list name).
