When developing to the REST api, you should be prepared to handle failed requests, understand their meaning and what actions are needed to resolve them.Â The following table is a complete list of extended error code responses, organized by the four elements included in the response array. 

* **Component**: The related service that the error has sourced from
* **Error Code:** The numeric code of the extended error
* **Notes:** The human readable description of the error
* **HTTP Status Code:** The server level response
