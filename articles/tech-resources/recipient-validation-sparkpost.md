SparkPost's Address Validation tool allows users to validate either a single address or upload a list of addresses.
The tool returns a pass/fail response for all addresses. If a particular address fails validation, the tool also provides a reason. The possible reasons for failing validation are "Invalid Domain", "Not an Email Address", "Invalid Email", or "Global Hardbounced Address".

Please reach out to your sales representative or Technical Account Manager about your particular email validation needs and details on pricing.
