### A/B Testing in SparkPost 

An A/B test, in summary, is a common method of comparing templates to see which one performs better. SparkPost provides the means to create new A/B tests and view completed results through our A/B Testing API.

**What benefits do I get from using A/B testing?** 

An A/B test is a method of comparing templates to see which one performs better by splitting a given recipient list across the number of templates you are comparing. Performing these tests on a limited percentage of a recipient list will allow you to send to the winning template your remaining audience, which can help drive better engagement results for your campaigns.

**Creation and review of A/B testing through the API** 

Please refer to the [A/B testing API documentation](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/ab-testing.html) for specifics on how to create and retrieve A/B tests.

**Notes about A/B testing specifics:**

* A "group" in the context of A/B testing is the combination of a template and the recipients assigned to receive that template.
* The winning template is automatically selected when the expiration time of the A/B test is reached. There are no manual controls to select a winning template. 
* The winning template is chosen by best open rate across all groups. If there is a tie in open rate among templates being tested, a random winner will be selected from the templates that tied. A GET of the A/B test's ID through the API will list the template winner.
* A minimum of 2 templates is required to run an A/B test. You may have up to a maximum of 10 templates in a single A/B test.
* A recipient list used in an A/B test can have a **maximum** of 2,000 recipients.
* The assignment of individual recipients into groups is randomized. You can pull which recipients were included in each group by performing a GET call with the A/B test's ID to the API endpoint.
* The total number of recipients in the recipient list *must* be greater than the sum of all recipients assigned to test groups. There must be *at least 1* remaining recipient not belonging to any test group.
* Templates **must be published** to be used in A/B testing. You cannot use draft templates.
* The published templates you are testing with **must have engagement tracking turned on.**
* Reporting by individual groups is available through both the [message events API](http://developers.sparkpost.com/api/message-events.html#message-events-message-events-get) (individual message events) and the [metrics API](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/metrics.html#metrics-deliverability-metrics-by-template-get) (aggregate statistics), and the UI.
  * For the message events API, you must filter by both campaign ID and template ID to pull individual recipient data.
  * To pull aggregate statistics by template performance, use the deliverability metrics by template as described in the metrics API link immediately above.
  * In the UI, you can filter all reports using the search bar or clickable filters by campaign and template.

**Best practices for A/B testing**

* Test as large a sample as you can for more accurate results. If possible, use the max that SparkPost allows - 2,000 recipients.
* Test often for the best results - a single test may not be enough to provide a conclusive winner, as results may change over time.
* Only test *one variable at a time* for best results when using A/B testing. This typically means that you should only change *one* variable in your template such as:
  * Subject line (*this is often the testing variable in the majority of tests*)
  * CTA (call to action)
  * Offer language/different offers
  * Header image
