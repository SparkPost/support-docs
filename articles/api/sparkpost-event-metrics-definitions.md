## SparkPost Event Definitions

The following table contains the definition of each type of event that exists for activity through SparkPost and SparkPost Enterprise. NOTE: Inbound relay events are only available in SparkPost Enterprise, i.e., they are not available in SparkPost.Individual events are provided via the webhook data stream and can be retrieved on an on-demand basis using the Message Events API.

| Event Name           | Belongs to the following Event Group | Other Names for this Event         | Event Generated When:                                                                                                                          |

| Policy_Rejection     | Bounce                               | In Band Bounce: Admin type failure | Due to policy, SparkPost rejects message or fails to generate message. (This is most often due to suppression list activity.)                  |
| Delay                | Delay                                | Tempfail/Transfail, 4xx error code | The remote mail server (of the recipient) temporarily rejects a message (asks for delivery to be tried again later).                           |
| Bounce               | Bounce                               | Permfail, 5xx error code           | The remote mail server (of the recipient)  **permanently** rejects message (delivery should not be attempted later)                            |
| out_of_band          | Bounce                               | Asynchronous Bounce                | Remote mail server (of the recipient) initially reported acceptance of a message, but now reports that the message cannot be delivered.        |
| spam_complaint       |                                      | Complaints/FBL                     | The message was classified as spam by the recipient.                                                                                           |

## SparkPost Metrics Definitions

The following contains the definition for each metric that is displayed in the SparkPost and SparkPost Elite UI. The Metrics API uses these same definitions, so results from the Metrics API will match the data displayed in the UI for the same date-time range interval.
