During installation, configuration files with reasonable defaults are added to the local copy of the configuration repository. Message Systems recommends you review the files found in `/opt/msys/ecelerity/etc/conf` before using Momentum in a production environment. For information about the configuration files, see [*Configuration Options Summary*](/momentum/4/config-options-summary) .

### Note

In a cluster environment, you can make configuration changes on any Platform node. Once changes have been added to the repository, Momentum will update all nodes.
