## DATE: MAY 25, 2018

This document provides the previous version of the formal end-of-life policy for releases of software from Message Systems. The end-of-life policy was updated on November 6, 2024 and is available [here](./eol-policy.md).

Unless contrary to a fully executed agreement between Message Systems and a relevant end-user, this policy shall govern the support and maintenance policies of Message Systems relating to superseded versions of its software.

## RELEASE VERSION NUMBERING

Message Systems defines an “Upgrade” as a major release, intended to provide significant additional features or utility to the software, which is typically identified by an ascending integer to the left of a decimal point, e.g. Momentum version 4.0 is an Upgrade to Momentum version 3.x.

Similarly, Message Systems defines an “Update” as a minor release, intended to enhance current features and/or fix bugs, which is typically identified by an ascending integer to the right of a decimal point, e.g. Momentum version 4.3 is an Update to Momentum version 4.2.

Message Systems also defines “Maintenance” as a release, intended only to correct defects, which is typically identified by an ascending integer to the right of the second decimal point, e.g. Momentum version 4.3.1 is a Maintenance release of Momentum version 4.3.0

## EOL POLICY FOR A GIVEN UPGRADE RELEASE

### New Features

New features will only be released in connection with a delivery of the most current version of the software, and will not be back-ported to older releases.

### Maintenance Mode

Maintenance mode is defined as a period of time when only Maintenance releases will be released. Maintenance releases will continue for a period of 1 year following the General Availability (GA) date of a subsequent Update release.

### End of Support

End of Support is defined as the time at which technical support is no longer available for a given Upgrade release. Support for older versions of products that have been Upgraded will be available, for those clients with a valid support and maintenance agreement in place, for a period of 2 years from the date the subsequent Upgrade was released. Clients that need support beyond this period should contact their sales representatives.

## EOL POLICY FOR A GIVEN UPDATE RELEASE

The same as Upgrade releases, except that any additional releases will only consist of Maintenance Releases of the most recent Update release.

## MOMENTUM 3 END-OF-LIFE DATE

Momentum version 4 became GA on April 15, 2014. Therefore:

- Maintenance for all versions of Momentum 3 will end on December 31, 2018.
- Support for all versions of Momentum 3 will end on December 31, 2018.

## MOMENTUM 4 GA DATES

| Upgrade and Update Versions | GA      | End of Maint | End of Support |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | -------------- |
