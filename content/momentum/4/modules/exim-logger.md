Momentum supports logging in the same style as the Open Source MTA Exim (http://www.exim.org). This is mainly of use to sites which are moving from an Exim install or otherwise have log-processing software that reads data in Exim-compliant format.

The exim_logger module writes to two log files: a `mainlog` where receptions, deliveries, and delivery failures are logged, and a `paniclog` where errors are logged.

### <a name="idp21723760"></a> Configuration

The exim_logger is configured through a configuration file using a stanza such as:

<a name="example.exim_logger.3"></a> 


```
exim_logger "exim_logger1" {
  mainlog  = "/var/log/exim/mainlog"
  paniclog = "/var/log/exim/paniclog"
  log_transient_failures = false
}
```

You can toggle the logging of transient failures using the `log_transient_failures` option.
