Momentum supports logging in the same style as the Open Source MTA Sendmail (http://www.sendmail.org). This is mainly of use to sites which are moving from a Sendmail install or otherwise have log-processing software that reads data in Sendmail-compliant format.

The sendmail_logger module writes to two logfiles: a `mainlog` where receptions, deliveries, and delivery failures are logged, and a `paniclog` where errors are logged.

### <a name="idp22868192"></a> Configuration

The sendmail_logger module is configured through a configuration file using a stanza such as:

<a name="example.sendmail_logger.3"></a> 


```
sendmail_logger "sendmail_logger1" {
  mainlog  = "/var/log/sendmail/mainlog"
  paniclog = "/var/log/sendmail/paniclog"
}
```
