<a name="idp22469744"></a> 

The `pipe_io` module provides facilities for writing content via an arbitrary program. Momentum uses an I/O abstraction layer for writing logs. With this module, you can post-process or transform logs.

`pipe_io` should not be used for post-processing the paniclog on Momentum nodes.

### <a name="idp22473584"></a> Configuration

This module is loaded automatically as required and does not need to be explicitly included. The configuration is in two parts: module-wide error logging and options for a specific pipe.

**<a name="idp22475408"></a> 71.54.1.1. Module Options**

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>error_file</dt>

<dd>

If the invoked program writes to `STDERR`, log it to this file. If this is not set, nothing will be logged.

</dd>

<dt>error_mode</dt>

<dd>

When creating `error_file`, use this file mode. Defaults to `0666`.

</dd>

<dt>output_file</dt>

<dd>

If the invoked program writes to `STDOUT`, log it to this file. If this is not set, nothing will be logged.

</dd>

<dt>output_mode</dt>

<dd>

When creating `output_file`, use this file mode. Defaults to `0666`.

</dd>

<dt>timeout</dt>

<dd>

When closing the pipe, `timeout` specifies how many seconds `pipe_io` should wait for the program to exit normally. If the program does not exit normally, `pipe_io` will terminate it.

</dd>

</dl>

**<a name="idp22490800"></a> 71.54.1.2. URI Parameters**

The URI specifies the path to the program that should be connected to the read end of the pipe; for example, `pipe:///usr/bin/myscript`. The URI parameters specify the environment and arguments for the program, and how to handle errors.

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>argN</dt>

<dd>

The Nth command-line parameter.

</dd>

<dt>clear_env</dt>

<dd>

If `1`, remove all variables from the environment. This can be used with `envN` to specify a complete environment for your program. By default, the program will inherit the environment of the parent process.

</dd>

<dt>envN</dt>

<dd>

Insert a variable into the environment. The value is of the form `name=value`.

</dd>

<dt>reinvoke</dt>

<dd>

If `1`, then one attempt will be made to restart the program if it exits unexpectedly. This is the default. Otherwise no attempt will be made to restart the program.

</dd>

<dt>shutdown_on_failure</dt>

<dd>

If `1`, shutdown if the program cannot be started, restarted, or exits unexpectedly. This is the default behavior One attempt will be made to restart the program (see `reinvoke`) -- the shutdown will occur if that fails.

If `0`, no shutdown will occur, but data will be lost silently.

</dd>

</dl>

### <a name="idp22507376"></a> Post-processing of Clustered Logs

The following example shows the use of `pipe_io` in `eccluster.conf` for post-processing of logs on the cluster manager.

<a name="example.pipe_io.3"></a> 


```
pipe_io {
  output_file = "/var/log/eccluster/pipe_io_output.log"
  output_mode = 0664
  error_file = "/var/log/eccluster/pipe_io_error.log"
  error_mode = 0664
  timeout = 5
}

Logs {
  # arg1 = path, last component is the log name
  # arg2 = log name
  # arg3 = node name
  logfile = "pipe:///opt/msys/ecelerity/bin/myscript?arg1=/var/log/eccluster/%Y/%m/%d/%{l}&arg2=%{l}&arg3=%{n}"
  file_mode = "0640"
  dir_mode = "0755"

  # Reopen logs every ten minutes, if there's no activity.
  # The pipe reader is expected to manage its own file handles
  # intelligently, so there is less need for eccmgr to age them out.
  max_idle = "600"
}
```

### <a name="idp22513296"></a> Other Considerations

*   Pipe readers should not do intensive post-processing, or any processing that will introduce significant latency (e.g., database access).

*   Pipe readers should be aware that the write end of the pipe is closed when logs are re-opened or when the instance shuts down.

*   To use this module on Linux, add `export ECELERITY_MEMORY=NOREPLACE` to `/opt/msys/ecelerity/etc/environment`.
