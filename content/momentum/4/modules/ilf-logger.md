The Incremental License Fee (ilf) logger module is designed for users who have usage-based licenses.

Bundle these files and sent them to Message Systems as appropriate.

In its default configuration, this module collects data on a daily basis. The following information is captured:

*   SMTP Receptions

*   SMTP Deliveries

*   SMPP Receptions

*   SMPP Deliveries

*   MM7 Receptions

*   MM7 Deliveries

*   Push Deliveries
