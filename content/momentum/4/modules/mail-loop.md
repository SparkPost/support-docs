The mail_loop module provides automatic suppression of potential mail loops with two standard mechanisms:

*   Suppression of delivery attempts to any configured IP interfaces on the machine.

*   Suppression of messages with more than a specified number of Received headers.

### <a name="idp22026800"></a> Configuration

The most basic configuration for the mail loop module is to suppress with a 554 code response a message with more than 20 received headers, as shown:

<a name="example.mail_loop.3"></a> 


```
mail_loop "mail_loop1"
{
  max_received_headers = 20
}
```

To also suppress delivery to any configured interface on the machine (interface addresses are resolved when Momentum starts), you can use:

`use_ip = true`

If you need to adjust the maximum number of allowed receive headers, do so as follows:

```
use_ip = false
max_received_headers = 32
```

Default value for `max_received_headers` is `20`.

### <a name="modules.mail_loop.context.variables"></a> Connection Context Variables

If you prefer to handle delivery suppression using policy scripts, you can disable the failing of messages by setting the return code to 250 as follows:

```
use_ip = true
max_received_headers = 32
code = 250
```

### Note

Disabling trace headers will reduce the accuracy of the mail loop detection.

In this case, a loop detection will set one of two connection context variables, depending on what sort of loop was detected:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>mail_loop_header_count</dt>

<dd>

Set to the number of received headers detected, if past the max_received_headers count.

</dd>

<dt>mail_loop_ip</dt>

<dd>

Set to `match`, if a self-connect was detected.

</dd>
