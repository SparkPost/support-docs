Momentum supports logging in the same style as the Open Source MTA Postfix (http://www.postfix.org). This is mainly of use to sites migrating from a Postfix installation or those that have log-processing software that reads data in Postfix-compliant format.

The postfix_logger module writes to two logfiles: a `mainlog` where receptions, deliveries, and delviery failures are logged, and a `paniclog` where errors are logged.

### <a name="idp22557856"></a> Configuration

The postfix_logger module is configured through a configuration file using a stanza such as:

<a name="example.postfix_logger.3"></a> 


```
postfix_logger "postfix_logger1" {
  mainlog  = "/var/log/postfix/mainlog"
  paniclog = "/var/log/postfix/paniclog"
  log_transient_failures = false
}
```

### Note

You must manually create the `postfix` directory and it must be writable by the user, `ecuser`. You must do this if you manually create the postfix module. You can change the ownership of the directory by issuing the shell command: **chown -R ecuser:ecuser /var/log/postfix** .

You can toggle the logging of transient failures using the `log_transient_failures` option.
