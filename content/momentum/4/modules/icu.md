The International Component for Unicode (ICU) is a mature, portable set of C/C++ libraries for Unicode support, software internationalization (I18N) and globalization (G11N), giving applications the same results on all platforms. The icu module for Momentum leverages ICU's robust set of unicode character set handling facilities to assist converting between various character sets and UTF-8.
