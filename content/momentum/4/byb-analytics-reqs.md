Analytics nodes have very specific requirements for the HP Vertica Analytic Database. Ensure that the node is suitable for Vertica prior to installation.

First, verify that each Vertica/Analytics node contains at least 8GB of RAM overall and at least 2GB of RAM per CPU.

Next run the `validate_vertica_node` script to ensure that the node's hardware is properly configured for Vertica. You can get this script from the Message Systems Support Download page. Click on Momentum 4.0.0, then click on 'Script to validate if the Analytics software can be installed on a server'. Please note: you will need to run `chmod +x validate_vertica_node` to make the script executable.

This validation script checks that these requirements have been met. After you download the script to the target server, ensure that it is executable and execute it. An unsuitable node will display errors such as the following:

```
