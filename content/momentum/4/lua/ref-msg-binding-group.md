## Name

msg:binding_group â€” Sets the binding_group to the named binding, if one is provided.

<a name="idp16632512"></a> 
## Synopsis

`msg:binding_group(value);`

`value: string, optional`<a name="idp16635456"></a> 
## Description

Sets the binding to one in the named binding_group, if one is provided. Returns the current or new value for the binding_group.

If the [adaptive module](/momentum/4/modules/4-adaptive) is enabled the logic for choosing a binding is as follows:

1.  An unsuspended binding local to the MTA

2.  A non-local unsuspended binding

3.  If all bindings are suspended, a local binding is randomly chosen

Enable this function with the statement `require('msys.extended.message');`.
