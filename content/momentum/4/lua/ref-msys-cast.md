## Description

Forces object to be re-interpreted as the specified class. This is provided primarily to map `void` object proxies to the correct underlying class type. This will result in crashes if the cast is used incorrectly; use with caution.

Because this function is in the `msys` namespace, an explicit `require` is not necessary.
