<a name="idp16856048"></a> 
## Synopsis

`msg:mime(readonly);`

`readonly: boolean, optional`<a name="idp16859024"></a> 
## Description

Returns the top of the MIME tree for the message, a message part. Setting `readonly` to `false`, indicates that modifications are going to be made and a MIME tree optimized for modifications is returned. If you attempt to modify a MIME part that is not writable, a runtime error will result. The returned part has a "thread" member that allows easy iteration of the MIME tree.

Enable this function with the statement `require('msys.extended.message');`.
