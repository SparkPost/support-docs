## Name

msys.parseRFC2822Addresses â€” Parse the address string per the address parsing rules defined in RFC2822

<a name="idp16184672"></a> 
## Synopsis

`msys.parseRFC2822Addresses(addressstring, component);`

```
addressstring: string
component: string
```
<a name="idp16187712"></a> 
## Description

Parse the address string per the address parsing rules defined in RFC2822\. *Note that this is NOT the same specification used to parse SMTP protocol addresses (RFC2821)* .

Where the address header is made up of `user+detail@domain`, the possible components are:

*   `all` the entire email address

*   `localpart` everything before the `@`

*   `user` the user portion

*   `detail` the detail portion

*   `domain` the domain portion

A table containing each detected address component is returned.

It is anticipated that you will usually want to use the `msg:address_header` function as it is more convenient.

Because this function is in the `msys` namespace, an explicit `require` is not necessary.
