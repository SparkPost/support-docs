## Synopsis

`msys.unlock(mutexname);`

## Description

Releases a lock obtained via msys.lock. **This function must be called from the same OS level thread that obtained it.** 

For example code see [thread.mutex](/momentum/4/lua/ref-thread-mutex).

Because this function is in the `msys` namespace, an explicit `require` is not necessary.
