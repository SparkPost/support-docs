## Name

```
value: string
type: string, optional
charset: string, optional
```

## Description

This function has the same semantics and purpose as the Message equivalent (see [msg:text](/momentum/4/lua/ref-msg-text)), except that it is scoped to the message part currently being referenced instead of the entire message.

This function does not always return a string. It can return `nil` on message parts where there is no body content.

### Warning

In the current design, this function applies encoding and MIME headers but **does not dot stuff** .

Enable this function with the statement `require('msys.extended.message');`.
