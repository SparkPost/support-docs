## Name

`/stats/summary` â€” show global metrics

## Synopsis

`GET /stats/summary`

## Description

Perhaps the most common API command, `/stats/summary` will produce global metrics such as queue sizes, message counts and throughput rates since startup or the last reset of statistics.

The data is formatted as a JSON object and you might want to use the `curl` command to do the request (e.g. `curl -sS localhost:2081/stats/summary`).

Sample output is shown below:

```json

  "InboundConcurrency": 1340,
  "ActiveDomains": 8253,
  "ActiveQueueSize": 39,
  "DelayedQueueSize": 2,
  "TotalQueueSize": 47,
  "DNSResolver": "ares",
  "DNSAQueries": 6307067,
  "DNSAAAAQueries": 0,
  "DNSMXQueries": 5361180,
  "DNSQueryRate": 2.25,
  "ResidentMessages": 120,

The report fields are as follows:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>OutboundConcurrency</dt>

<dd>

The current number of established outbound sessions.

</dd>

<dt>InboundConcurrency</dt>

<dd>

The current number of established inbound sessions.
