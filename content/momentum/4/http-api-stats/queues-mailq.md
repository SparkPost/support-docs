## Name

`/stats/queues/mailq` â€” show the status of the mail queues

## Synopsis

`GET /stats/queues/mailq`

`GET /stats/queues/mailq?domain=some.domain`

`GET /stats/queues/mailq?binding=ip_1.2.3.4`

## Description

When issued with no arguments this command shows counts for the active queue and the delayed queues sorted by binding groups and bindings.

The data is formatted as a JSON object and you might want to use the `curl` command to do the request (e.g. `curl -sS localhost:2081/stats/queues/mailq`).

Sample output is shown below:

```json
{
  "QueueSummary": [
    {
      "group": "bg_new",
      "binding": "ip_23.45.67.89",
      "domain": "a.random.domain",
      "aq": 1,
      "dq": 284,
      "receptions": 1048,
      "permfails": 1056,
      "transfails": 11612,
      "deliveries": 0
    },
    {
      "group": "spc:123456:foobar_1",
      "binding": "ip_12.34.56.78",
      "domain": "some.other.domain",
      "aq": 0,
      "dq": 0,
      "receptions": 0,
      "permfails": 0,
      "transfails": 0,
      "deliveries": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The `group` and `binding` fields shows the group and the binding that a domain belongs to. `aq` shows the items in the active queue and `aq` shows the items in the delayed queue. The number of receptions, permanent failures, transient failures, and deliveries are shown in the `receptions`, `permfails`, `transfails`, and `deliveries` fields respectively.

Use this request with the `domain=a.specific.domain` argument to show the statistics for a specific domain, and the `binding=name` can be used in the same way to show a specific binding. The output cannot be limited or split into multiple pages.

Examples of using the optional arguments:

```bash
# Check the queue for the "gmail.com" domain
curl -sS "localhost:2081/stats/queues/mailq?domain=gmail.com"

# Check the queue for the "gmail.com" domain related to the IP 1.2.3.4
curl -sS "localhost:2081/stats/queues/mailq?domain=gmail.com&binding=ip_1.2.3.4"
```

The output might be a somewhat large JSON array, so to make it easier to read, you can try using `jq` and `column` to convert it to a table:

```bash
# Table with just bindings, domains, AQ and DQ
curl -sS "localhost:2081/stats/queues/mailq" | \
    jq -r '(["BINDING","DOMAIN","AQ","DQ"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.QueueSummary|.[]|[.binding,.domain,.aq,.dq])|@tsv' | \
    column -t

# Table with all fields
curl -sS "localhost:2081/stats/queues/mailq" | \
    jq -r '(["GROUP","BINDING","DOMAIN","AQ","DQ","RECEPTIONS","PERMFAILS","TRANSFAILS","DELIVERIES"]|(.,map(length*"-"))),(.QueueSummary|.[]|[.group,.binding,.domain,.aq,.dq,.receptions,.permfails,.transfails,.deliveries])|@tsv' | \
    column -t
```

And the output will be something like this:

```
GROUP                BINDING     DOMAIN       AQ  DQ  RECEPTIONS  PERMFAILS  TRANSFAILS  DELIVERIES
-----                -------     ------       --  --  ----------  ---------  ----------  ----------
amet:1:lorem         ip_1.2.3.4  gmail.com    5   0   14107       1          10          14092
consectetur:1:ipsum  ip_2.3.4.5  hotmail.com  5   0   224         0          0           215
adipiscing:1:dolor   ip_3.4.5.6  yahoo.com    5   0   181         23         153         0
elit:1:sit           ip_4.5.6.7  hotmail.com  4   0   223         0          0           216
```

## Note

This command was implemented in Momentum 4.4.1.
