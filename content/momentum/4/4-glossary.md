<dt><a name="gloss.amqp"></a> Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

AMQP is an open standard for message-oriented middleware used by Momentum 4\. For more information see [ampq.org](http://www.amqp.org/).

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.aggregator"></a> Aggregator</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

In a Momentum 4 cluster configuration, an aggregator or cluster aggregation node is a node used for cluster log aggregation. If you require log aggregation, you must install Momentum 4 on the aggregator first. An aggregator is referred to as a Platform node but it does not perform any messaging functions.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.campaign"></a> Campaign</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

All messages based on a single piece of copy. A campaign contains recipients and template information. You may have a campaign group that contains related messages.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.click.tracking"></a> Click Tracking</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Tracking of clicks on the links within a message. In order to track clicks set the `click_tracking` field of the transmission object to `true`.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.content"></a> Content</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A component of the template that can include: html, text, SMS MMS rich media, push payload, or other recipient-viewable data.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.conversion"></a> Conversion</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

When the recipient of a message performs the desired action; receiver goes beyond open and click.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.eec"></a> Email Experience Council (EEC)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

The EEC is a global organization that strives to enhance the image of email marketing and communications, while actively advocating its importance to business. For more information see [Email Experience Council](http://www.emailexperience.org/).

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.injection.metadata"></a> Injection Metadata</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Key value pairs associated with an injection which are included in the event stream and are available for filtering or reporting. These key value pairs are also given to the substitution engine as a convenience to the customer (with recipient metadata taking precedence over injection metadata when there are conflicts).

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.injection.substitution.data"></a> Injection Substitution Data</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Injection-specific JSON data which is supplied to the substitution engine. Recipient substitution data takes precedence over injection substitution data. Unlike metadata, substitution data is not included in any event streams and is not available for filtering or reporting.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-ip-warmup"></a> IP Warmup</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

The concept behind "IP Warmup" is that new IPs need to build a reputation with ISPs. For example, if you send 100,000 emails from a newly acquired IP address that has no history, most large ISPs will block email from this address. IP Warmup slowly increases the send rate on new IPs so that ISPs have time to gauge customer feedback. If there are minimal spam/abuse reports then the ISP will allow an increased send rate.

Sometimes an IP with a good reputation will accidentally send bad content and damage its own reputation. In such cases, it may be necessary to re-establish a good reputation by temporarily suspending sending, reducing the send rate, or by "re-warming" the IP address. With Momentum, this is achieved using the adaptive module, which automatically sets any new bindings to "zero days old" and then slowly increases the send rate unless it starts seeing negative feedback. If this happens, the adaptive module throttles or temporarily suspends the IP address according to internal rules. For more information about the adaptive module, see [“adaptive – Adaptive Delivery”](/momentum/4/modules/4-adaptive).

<dt><a name="gloss.json"></a> JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It is the input and output format used by the REST API.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.mime"></a> Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.open.tracking"></a> Open Tracking</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Track the opening of messages.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-p0f"></a> Passive operating system (OS) fingerprinting (p0f)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

During network communication, passively collect information about the remote device with the intent of inferring the OS. Doing this makes improved TCP/IP communication possible. You must install the Policy Tools suite to enable p0f.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.quorum"></a> Quorum</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

In cluster configurations a quorum is the minimum number of active machines that will allow Momentum to continue functioning. Should any nodes go down, you need a quorum within both your Platform servers and within your Analytics servers in order for Momentum to continue functioning. For Momentum, 51% or more active nodes makes up a quorum.

Whenever quorum is lost and regained, the node(s) that lost quorum must inquire whether they have lost the jobs that they were previously working on. This is necessary to minimize the number of duplicate messages that are sent.

What constitutes a quorum has implications for redundancy. For example, you cannot support redundancy with only two Analytics and two Platform nodes. Should any one node go down, you will not have the 51% required for a quorum. Redundancy is only supported with clusters of three or more Analytics *and* Platform nodes.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss.raw.clicks"></a> Raw Clicks</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">
