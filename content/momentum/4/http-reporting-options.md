For every message injected, Momentum reports data tracking its full disposition status. You can view this reporting data using the following:

*   Web-based User Interface – Using this flexible, easy-to-use interface, you can evaluate your message deliverability and campaign performance. See the tutorial in [*Using the UI for Reporting*](/momentum/4/reporting-ui) .

*   Metrics API – Using the [Metrics API](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-rest/v1_index.html), you can retrieve statistical, real-time data about message processing, message disposition, and campaign performance. See the tutorial in [*Using the Metrics API for Reporting*](/momentum/4/reporting-metrics) .

*   Webhooks – Using the [Webhooks API](https://support.messagesystems.com/docs/web-rest/v1_index.html) or the Webhooks page of the UI, you can receive push updates of the raw events generated by Momentum. See the tutorial in [*Using Webhooks for Event Data*](/momentum/4/reporting-webhooks) .

*   jlog files – Using the configuration options in the event_hydrant module, you can direct event data to jlog files. See [“event_hydrant – Message Tracking”](/momentum/4/modules/event-hydrant).
