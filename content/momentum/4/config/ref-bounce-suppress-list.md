## Name

bounce_suppress_list — configure a list of email addresses that may not be considered original recipients.

## Synopsis

`bounce_suppress_list = "comma-separated list of email addresses"`

## Description

When a Message Delivery Notification (MDN) is received, this option will suppress certain addresses from being identified as the purported original sender.

An MDN is an out-of-band notification of delivery failure. Momentum's out-of-band bounce processing capability includes an algorithm which attempts to extract the original recipient from the MDN. You can use the `Bounce_Suppress_List` option to improve the accuracy of this algorithm by excluding addresses and/or domains that you know could not have been the original recipient.

To disqualify an email address like `bounces@bounces.example.com` from being considered a potential original recipient, you would specify:

```
bounce_domains = ( bounces.example.com )
bounce_suppress_list = "bounces@bounces.example.com"
```

You can also specify domains that you would like to disqualify, as shown below. Multiple addresses can be specified by using a comma separated list.

```
bounce_domains = ( bounces.example.com )
bounce_suppress_list = "bounces@bounces.example.com,@bounces.example.org"
```
