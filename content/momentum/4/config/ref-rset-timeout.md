## Description

The amount of time in seconds to wait for a response to a `RSET` command. `RSET` commands are used to reset the state of an SMTP session in which a transaction has only partially succeeded. It allows subsequent messages to be delivered down a single SMTP session immediately following a transient or permanent failure response from the remote server before the complete and successful delivery of the prior message. The default value is `30`.
