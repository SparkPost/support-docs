## Name

cluster_scope_max_outbound_connections â€” provide traffic shaping for outbound connections in a cluster configuration

## Synopsis

`cluster_scope_max_outbound_connections = 20`

## Description

`cluster_scope_max_outbound_connections` is for use in a cluster configuration and is the equivalent of `scope_max_outbound_connections`. It provides for finer-grained manipulation of the number of outbound connections than does `cluster_scope_max_outbound_connections`. When used in different scopes its behavior is as follows:

*   In the global scope, it behaves like `cluster_server_max_outbound_connections`

*   In a Global::Domain scope, it determines the maximum number of connections to the specified domain across all bindings

*   In a Binding_Group::Domain scope, it determines the maximum number of connections to the specified domain across all the bindings in that Binding Group

*   In a Binding::Domain scope, it behaves like `cluster_max_outbound_connections`

*   In a Global:Host scope it determines the maximum number of connections to the specified host across all bindings

`cluster_scope_max_outbound_connections` is disabled by default. When it is not set then `cluster_max_outbound_connections` or `cluster_server_max_outbound_connections` is used, depending on the context.

To use this option the `Replicate "outbound_binding_domains" {}` stanza must be defined in `ecelerity-cluster.conf`.
