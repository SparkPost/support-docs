## Name

skip_hosts â€” skip the specified host, but consider other hosts in the domain

## Synopsis

`skip_hosts = ("127.0.0.1")`

`skip_hosts = ("127.0.0.1" "fe80::a00:1")`

<a name="idp26510864"></a> 
## Description

Unlike [prohibited_hosts](/momentum/4/config/ref-prohibited-hosts), `Skip_hosts` does not permanently deny a domain. Instead, it enables you to skip the specified host but still consider other hosts in the domain. For example, to prevent delivery to loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8) or the null route 0.0.0.0, you can use the following line:

`skip_hosts = ( "127.0.0.0/8" "0.0.0.0" )`
### Note

Note: This setting does not affect where you receive mail from, only where you can deliver mail to.
