## Name

server_reserve_outbound_connections â€” sets the server-wide connection limit reserve

## Synopsis

`Server_Reserve_Outbound_Connections = 200`

<a name="idp26455440"></a> 
## Description

`Server_Reserve_Outbound_Connections` configures the server-wide connection limit reserve. The sum of `Server_Reserve_Outbound_Connections` and `Server_Max_Outbound_Connections` is used to set the ceiling on the total number of outbound connections that Momentum will establish. The default value for this option is `200`.

### Note

`server_reserve_outbound_connections` must be set to `0` in order for `scope_max_outbound_connections` to work properly in the Global::Domain scope. However, when `server_reserve_outbound_connections` is set to `0` and the server is under load, low volume domains may be starved of connections.

It is recommended that you leave this value as is and alter `Server_Max_Outbound_Connections` at either the global scope or within a given binding instead.
