## Name

cluster_outbound_throttle_connections â€” limit the rate at which connections are established, and enforce it across a cluster of systems

## Synopsis

`Cluster_Outbound_Throttle_Connections = "1"`

`Cluster_Outbound_Throttle_Connections = "1/60"`

<a name="idp23848592"></a> 
## Description

This allows you to limit the rate at which Momentum will attempt to establish TCP/IP connections. It can be employed to globally limit connection allocation or to reduce the rate established to a particular binding_group.

If a single integer parameter is provided, Momentum will ensure that no more than the specified number of connections are initiated in a given second. If a proper fraction parameter is provided, Momentum will limit the number of connection initiations to the number specified in the numerator over the time window in seconds specified by the denominator.

### Note

The cluster module must be configured with the outbound throttle parameters.

## Scope

`cluster_outbound_throttle_connections` is valid in the binding_group, domain, and global scopes.
