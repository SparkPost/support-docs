## Name

domainkeys â€” enable or disable domainkeys signing

## Synopsis

`domainkeys = "enabled"`
`domainkeys = "disabled"`

<a name="idp24391872"></a> 
## Description

This directive instructs Momentum to enable (or disable) signing messages with a DomainKeys signature globally, on a specific domain, binding, or domain within a binding. To use this directive, you must also configure the [`dk_sign`](/momentum/4/modules/domainkeys) module. When the dk_sign module is loaded, signing occurs for all messages by default. This is the same as setting `domainkeys = "enabled"` at the global scope.

## Scope

domainkeys is valid in the binding, binding_group, domain, and global scope.
