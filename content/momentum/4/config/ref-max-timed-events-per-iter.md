## Name

## Synopsis

## Description

This option provides an upper boundary on how many timed events are dispatched in a single scheduler iteration. This caps the number of timed events that will be processed by the scheduler before tending to events triggered by network traffic, preventing network events from being starved by time-based events.

The default value is `1024`.
