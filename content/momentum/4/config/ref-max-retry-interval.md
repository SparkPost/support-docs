## Name

max_retry_interval â€” maximum retry interval

## Synopsis

`Max_Retry_Interval = "43200"`

<a name="idp25359904"></a> 
## Description

The maximum interval between successive retries for a message. This provides a cap on the effective retry calculated from `Retry_Interval`. The default value for this option is `43200` seconds (12 hours).

### Warning

Note that the `Max_Retries` setting has a bearing on this option. The default value for `Max_Retries` is "auto" so be sure to change it to a positive integer or "none" if you plan to use `Max_Retry_Interval`. When `Max_Retries` is set to a positive integer, messages expire within `Messsage_Expiration` seconds or after the specified number of retries, whichever occurs first. When `Max_Retries` is "none" there is no limit on the number of retries of a message; the message will expire by `Message_Expiration` only.

Consider the following configuration snippet:

```
Retry_Interval = 1200
Max_Retry_Interval = 1200
Max_Retries = 5
```

Given this configuration, a bounced message will be retried every 1200 seconds and will expire in 6000 seconds unless `Message_Expiration` is set to a value lower than 6000\. In which case, the message will expire in `Messsage_Expiration` seconds. "Max_Retry_Interval" caps "Retry_Interval" at 1200\. Without it a bounced message would expire in 37200 seconds (unless Messsage_Expiration is less than this number) because the retry interval is doubled each time as follows:

```
1200
       2400
       4800
       9600
      19200
