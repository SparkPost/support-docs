## Name

## Synopsis

## Description

Address metrics store data on the quality of service to a particular target host from a particular binding; data such as the time since the last failure, and how long it takes to connect and to deliver a message. Address metrics are used to determine which of a domain's MXs to open more connections to. `address_metrics_lifetime` controls how long a set of address metrics will live after last being updated. Normally this option does not need to be changed.

The default value is 1800 seconds.
