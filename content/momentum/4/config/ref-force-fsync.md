## Name

force_fsync â€” ensure that data is synced to disk on reception

## Synopsis

`force_fsync = false`

`force_fsync = true`

<a name="idp24601440"></a> 
## Description

Upon receiving a message, but before a 250 response is sent to the client confirming receipt of that message, Momentum must write the message to the spool. If the system does not invoke the `fsync` call, it cannot guarantee that the message has been completely journalled to permanent storage.

If this option is set to true, `fsync` (or `fdatasync` if available) will be called prior to returning a confirmation to the SMTP client. If it is false, the system will not.

Mail systems concerned about losing messages during a system crash should set this option to `true`

The default is `false`.

force_fsync is valid in the global scope.
