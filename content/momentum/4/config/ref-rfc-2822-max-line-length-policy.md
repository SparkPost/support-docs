## Synopsis

<a name="idp26153728"></a> 
## Description

This option defines how messages with non-RFC-compliant line lengths are handled. When set to `none`, messages are processed as usual. When set to `fix`, Momentum will attempt to fix the body of the message. When set to `reject`, messages with non-RFC-compliant line lengths are rejected.

When `rfc2822_max_line_length_policy` is set to a value other than `none`, it is recommended that `rfc2822_max_line_length` be set to a *numeric* value greater than the RFC guideline. For example, `rfc2822_max_line_length = 2048`.

The default value for this option is `none`.
