## Name

max_dns_ttl â€” set the maximum DNS TTL

## Synopsis

`max_dns_ttl = 4294967295`

<a name="idp25206016"></a> 
## Description

`max_dns_ttl` and `min_dns_ttl` are optional overrides to the TTL values returned from DNS (only as far as resolving SMTP destinations is concerned; the DNS cache used by other parts of the system such as DKIM is not affected by these parameters). Setting a `min_dns_ttl` can be used to prevent excessive DNS lookups in the event that an SMTP destination you are delivering mail to has unreasonably short TTL values for its DNS records. Conversely, `max_dns_ttl` can be used to force lookups to happen more often if a destination domain has excessively long TTL values in its DNS records. Setting this option should only be necessary in exceptional circumstances.

Default value is `4294967295`.
