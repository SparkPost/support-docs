## Name

malloc2mmap_threshold â€” use mmap when allocations exceed this amount

## Synopsis

`malloc2mmap_threshold = 4092`

<a name="idp25128832"></a> 
## Description

When set to a positive value, Momentum will use `mmap` to fulfill memory allocation requirements exeeding the `malloc2mmap_threshold` size, rather than allocating memory from the heap via `malloc`.

Lowering this setting can reduce heap fragmentation and the system RSS, but can use more address space than heap allocations alone, since the minimum granularity of `mmap` is the system page size.

The default is 4092.
