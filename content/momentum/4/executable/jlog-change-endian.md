## Name

jlog_change_endian â€” change the endianness of a jlog

## Synopsis

`/opt/msys/jlog/bin/jlog_change_endian` *`source`* { tole | tobe } *`destination`*

## Description

This command creates an exact copy of a jlog with the opposite endianness of the original. If it detects a problem in the source jlog, it will print an error message and not create the copy. For this reason, you should run [jlog_sanity_check](/momentum/4/executable/jlog-sanity-check) on the source jlog first, to make sure it is error-free. This command should be run as `ecuser`.

The first argument is the path to the jlog you want to convert.

The second argument indicates the endianness of the destination jlog (and implicitly of the source jlog). `tole` will convert a big-endian jlog to little-endian (e.g. sparc to i386), while `tobe` will convert a little-endian jlog to big-endian (e.g. i386 to sparc).

The third argument is the path where you want the converted jlog to be written; it must not exist, but its parent directory must exist before you run `jlog_change_endian.pl`.
