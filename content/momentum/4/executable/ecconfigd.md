## Synopsis

`/opt/msys/ecelerity/sbin/ecconfigd` [ --log-level {*`level`*} ] --debug

## Description

**ecconfigd** is the Momentum Configuration Server. Configuration files are maintained in a version control repository and exported via this service. The user for this service is `ecuser`. The associated password is created during installation.

The service consists of two processes. In a cluster configuration, one process participates in the messaging bus to maintain membership, and the other process, active in both cluster and stand-alone configurations, is an Apache-based Subversion server listening on port 2027\. Together these processes manage the configuration repositories for the clusters on the network or for a single-node system. Momentum's version control management tool is **eccfg**. It is used to track and update configuration file changes.

**ecconfigd** always uses SSL. The self-signed certificate created during installation is valid for a year. To renew this certificate, use the **create_ssl_cert** command.

When **ecconfigd** is started using the script in the `/etc/init.d` directory, if the service doesn't start immediately, it will try for up to a minute to connect. This occurs only if there is a `cluster.boot` file in the `/opt/msys/ecelerity/etc` directory.

Use **ecconfigd_ctl** to start, stop, or restart this server.

### Note

It is advisable to restart **ecconfigd** after making extensive changes to `msgc_server.conf`, such as adding multiple nodes. Use the command **`/etc/init.d/ecconfigd restart`**         .

No additional arguments are required for normal operation. However, the `EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable may be used to control how **ecconfigd** is started. If this variable is set, its contents will be passed as additional arguments to **ecconfigd**. The following arguments may be specified as part of EXTRA_ARGS:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>--debug</dt>

<dd>

Run in the foreground and set the log level to 7.

</dd>

<dt>--log-level *`level`*</dt>

<dd>

Set the log file verbosity. The log level is a number from 0 to 7, where higher numbers result in more information. The default log level is 4, which logs warnings and errors.

</dd>

</dl>
