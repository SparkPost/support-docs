The `mainlog` logs reception, delivery, transient failure, permanent failure, and heartbeat events. It is configured in the [ec_logger](/momentum/4/modules/ec-logger).

Every event is written to the `mainlog` file as a single line. Fixed position codes signify whether the log line represents a reception (`R`), delivery (`D`), transient failure (`T`), or permanent failure (`P`). The log entry format differs depending upon the event type.

The following sections define the format for each event type.

### <a name="idp4862592"></a> Reception Records

A reception line is written to the `mainlog` for every reception that Momentum performs. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

```
1064868656@00/00-25004-31B987F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@R »
@bob@example.fict@info@postalengine.com@10.0.1.1@201@esmtp@default@default
```

The following is a description of the fields:

| 13 | default | MultiVIP® binding to which the message was assigned |

### <a name="idp4904224"></a> Delivery Records

A delivery line is written to the `mainlog` for every message that is delivered by Momentum, including transfers between nodes. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

```
1064871280@20/00-25593-945A87F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@D@ »

| 11 | 10.0.0.1 | IP address that accepted the message |

### <a name="idp4940624"></a> Transient Failure Records

A transient failure line is written to the `mainlog` for every transient failure that occurs. A transient failure is a failure that allows Momentum to retry sending the message. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

```
1064869327@00/00-25593-CBD987F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@T@ »

| 13 | 421 no adequate servers | Error message associated with the failure |

### <a name="idp4979488"></a> Permanent Failure Records

A permanent failure line is written to the `mainlog` for every permanent failure that occurs. A permanent failure indicates that the attempted message failed in such a way that it should not be retried again. After logging a permanent failure, the message will be discarded. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

```
1064870847@10/00-25593-393A87F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@P@ »

```

The following is a description of the fields:

<a name="log_formats.permanent.failure.record.fields"></a> 


| Offset | Example Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064870847 | Date of permanent failure in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970) |
| 1 | 10/00-25593-393A87F3 | Message's unique message-id |

| 11 | 3.89 | Amount of time, in seconds, between reception and the time of permanent failure |
| 12 | 10.0.0.1 | IP address of the server that rejected the message |
| 13 | 552 No such account | Error message returned from the remote host |

### <a name="idp5017632"></a> Heartbeat Records

In addition to the records described in the previous sections, a heartbeat is written periodically to the log, indicating that Momentum is still active and may log further data. The log entry is an `@` delimited string, such as the following:

`1251470342@@@@M`

The following is a description of the fields:

<a name="log_formats.heartbeat.main.fields"></a> 


| Offset | Example Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1251470342 | Date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970) |
| 1 |   | Unused |
| 2 |   | Unused |
| 3 |   | Unused |
| 4 | M | `M` indicating a heartbeat |

Having three unused fields ensures that, like other logs, the fifth field is the log entry type. This makes parsing easier.
