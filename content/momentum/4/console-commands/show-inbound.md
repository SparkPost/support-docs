## Description

This command shows all inbound connections. In the following example, the output has been wrapped for display purpose. "23" is the file descriptor of the related event. "async body response (for 0.264s)" shows the last state of the messages coming in via this connection and the time spent in that state. "[floating]" means the messages coming in via this connection are not handled by the main scheduler right now. -->
