## Description

The **binding fail domain quiet**                   command allows the administrative failure of all messages bound for the specified domain on the specified binding in such a way that no bounce is sent, even if Generate_Bounces is set in the server configuration. Its usage is similar to **binding fail domain** :

```
ecelerity> binding fail domain quiet BINDING1 unresolvableproblems.com
unresolvableproblems.com purged, 62415 messages failed.
```

You may substitute `all` for the domain name to apply to all domains.

```
ecelerity> binding fail domain quiet BINDING1 all
All domains purged.  62415 messages failed.
