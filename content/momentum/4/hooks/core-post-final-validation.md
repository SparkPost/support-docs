## Name

post_final_validation — This hook is invoked after the normal
[final_validation](/momentum/3/3-api/hooks-core-final-validation) hook

## Synopsis

`#include "hooks/core/final_validation.h"`

`int core_post_final_validation(void closure, ec_message *msg, accept_construct *ac, valiate_context *ctx)`


## Description

This hook is invoked right after the
[final_validation](/momentum/3/3-api/hooks-core-final-validation) hook. Its return value
does not have significance for now.
This hook is added as the absolute last point before writing the message to spool for delivery.
It guarantees that operations implemented in this hook will happen after the operations done in
`final_validation`.
To avoid undefined ordering between multiple implementations of the same hook, you shall have at most
 one implementation for this hook.
> It's the recommended hook point for ARC signing/sealing.


**Parameters**

The parameters from this hook are the same as the ones for `final_validation` hook.

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>closure</dt>

<dd>

A pointer to the closure function.

</dd>

<dt>msg</dt>

<dd>

A pointer to an ec_message struct. For documentation of this data structure see [“ec_message”](/momentum/3/3-api/structs-ec-message)

</dd>

<dt>ac</dt>

<dd>

The `accept_construct` struct. For documentation of this data structure see [“accept_construct”](/momentum/3/3-api/structs-accept-construct)

</dd>

<dt>ctx</dt>

<dd>

The `validate_context` struct. For documentation of this data structure see [“validate_context”](/momentum/3/3-api/structs-validate-context)

</dd>

</dl>

**Return Values**

This hook returns `int`, but for now the return value has no significance, i.e. it is not checked in
the caller.

**Threading**

This hook will be called in any thread.
