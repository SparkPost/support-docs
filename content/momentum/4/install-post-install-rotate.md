Several non-rotated logfiles are generated by components installed with Momentum 4\. You must set up log rotation for these logfiles to prevent them from growing very large over time. For a list of the non-rotated logfiles, see [*Rotating Logs **ec_rotate***](/momentum/4/log-rotating) .

Follow the steps below to set up log rotation for Vertica.

1.  Create an empty file.

    `touch /opt/vertica/config/logrotate/msys`
2.  Apply read/write permissions to the new file.

    `chmod a+rw /opt/vertica/config/logrotate/msys`
3.  Change to the `vertica_dba` account.

    sudo su - *`vertica_dba`*
4.  Set up weekly log rotation on the `msys` database. Also set files older than 12 days to be deleted.

    `admintools -t logrotate -d msys -r weekly -k 12`

### Note

The log is only rotated if it is over 10M.
