From the Settings section, you can delete an API key. Click the icon to the right of the API key that you want to delete. In the list, click Delete, as shown in [“Delete API Key”](/momentum/4/web-ui-apikeys-delete#figure_delete_apikey).

Deleting an API key revokes all future actions that requests with that API key will take. This is irreversible.

If the API key is successfully deleted, a message will display upon return to the Settings section. Click the x to close the message.
