Publishing a template makes the published version the default for transmissions that use the template. You can continue to use a template's draft version, if any, by specifying its use in the transmission API request.

To publish your template, click the arrow on the right-hand side of the Save Draft button. In the list, click Publish, as shown in [“Publish Template”](/momentum/4/web-ui-templates-publish#figure_publish_template).

A published template can still be edited, either by editing the published version or by creating a new draft.
