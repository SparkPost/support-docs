This chapter describes the non-module options related to Google Push notifications. For a description of the options valid within the scope of the Google modules see [“gcm Module”](/momentum/3/3-push/push-gcm-modules#push.modules.gcm).

This chapter also contains a section on existing Momentum options that must be configured in order to use GCM.

These GCM options are valid in some or all of the following scopes: the domain, binding_group, binding and global scopes. Of the GCM-specific options, you must configure `gcm_authorization_token_id`. You can use the default values for other GCM-specific options.
