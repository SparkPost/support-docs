In order to configure Momentum for APNs you must use the `apn` module. If you wish to log APNs notifications, then you will also need to configure the `apn_logger` module.

## <a name="apns.apn_module"></a> apn Module

**Configuration Change.Â ** This feature is available as of version 3.5.4.

The apn module is a requirement if you wish to use the Apple Push Notification service.

### <a name="apns.apn_module.configuration"></a> Configuration

`apn { }`

There are no options for this module other than the two common to all modules, namely `enabled` and `debug_level`. For more information see [Module Overview](/momentum/3/3-reference/modules-overview-implicit).

In a cluster configuration, the apn module must be enabled on each MTA node used to deliver Apple Push notifications.
