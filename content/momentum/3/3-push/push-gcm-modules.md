In order to configure Momentum for GCM you must use the `gcm` module. If you wish to log GCM notifications, then you will also need to configure the `gcm_logger` module.

## <a name="push.modules.gcm"></a> gcm Module

**Configuration Change.Â ** This feature is available as of version 3.5.5.

The gcm module is a requirement if you wish to use the Google Cloud Messaging service. It creates the JSON-encoded message for delivery to the GCM server using HTTP Post requests. This module also handles HTTP Post *responses*, implementing a mechanism to retry messages and provide permanent failure processing for messages that fail or are not accepted for delivery by GCM servers.

### <a name="push.configuration"></a> Configuration

`gcm {}`

There are no options for this module other than the two common to all modules, namely `enabled` and `debug_level`. For more information see [Module Overview](/momentum/3/3-reference/modules-overview-implicit).

In a cluster configuration, the gcm module must be enabled on each MTA node used to deliver Google Push notifications.

### <a name="push.gcm.context"></a> Context Variables

There is only one context variable specifically associated with Google and that is `GCM_Retry_After` which corresponds to the Google `Retry-After` field. Other context variables are the generic delivery context variables beginning with `DLV_`. For a list of these variables see [*Callouts and Push Notifications*](/momentum/3/3-push/push-generic-delivery-lua) .

You can access these variables from a script and use them to customize the behavior of Momentum or to customize the content of notifications. They are also used by the gcm_logger module.
