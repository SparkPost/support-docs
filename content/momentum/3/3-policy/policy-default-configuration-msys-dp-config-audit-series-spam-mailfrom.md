Spam MAIL FROM rate limiting. Note: This is disabled by default as there is a potential for a DoS attack using garbage sender addresses.

Find below the sample excerpt included in the `dp_config.lua` file.

```
msys.dp_config.audit_series.spam_mailfrom = {
  type = "string",
  interval = 900,
  buckets = 4,
  thresholds = {
    { check = false,
      startv = 0,
      endv = 3,
      threshold = 100,
      honor_whitelist = { "global" }
    }
  },
  options = {
    persist = true
  }
};
```

The elements of this configuration table are as follows:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>type</dt>

<dd>

The only legal value for this element is `string`.

</dd>

<dt>interval</dt>

<dd>

The time interval that you wish to look at measured in seconds. A reasonable value might be `900`.

</dd>

<dt>buckets</dt>

<dd>

A bucket is a window of time of the length defined by "interval". A reasonable value might be `4`.

</dd>

<dt>thresholds</dt>

<dd>

Count over which we do not allow any more . `thresholds` is a nested table with this configuration option. The following list defines the attributes of the individual thresholds.

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>check</dt>

<dd>

Whether or not to use this configuration item.

</dd>

<dt>startv</dt>

<dd>

The starting bucket (0 is the current bucket) to query across.

</dd>

<dt>endv</dt>

<dd>

The ending bucket.

</dd>

<dt>threshold</dt>

<dd>

The threshold for this specific .. When this threshold is exceeded code `451` is issued along with the message `Sender spam message rate limit exceeded`.

</dd>

<dt>honor_whitelist</dt>

<dd>

A table listing any applicable whitelists set in the `msys.dp_config.whitelist` table.

</dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<dt>options</dt>

<dd>

This item is a table with the following possible keys:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>serialize</dt>

<dd>

Write audit series to log. The value may be `true` or `false`; `false` is the default.

When `true`, the log will be written to the directory defined by the `serialize_dir` option in the [inbound_audit](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-modules-inbound-audit) module. The default value for this option is `/var/log/ecelerity/audit_series_persist`.

</dd>

<dt>replicate</dt>

<dd>

Defaults to none, but can be `cluster` to send to all nodes, or `manager` to send only to cluster manager nodes. This requires explicit configuration in the `cluster` stanza to operate correctly. For more information see [Data Replication](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-cluster-config-replication).

</dd>

<dt>persist</dt>

<dd>

When set to `true`, the audit series will be persisted. The persisted series will be reloaded when the engine restarts. The default value is `false`.

</dd>

</dl>
