**Configuration Change.Â ** This feature is available as of version 3.5.5.

This struct is defined as follows:

```
typedef struct _apn_error_response {
  uint8_t command;
  uint8_t status;
  uint32_t id;   /* host order */
} apn_error_response;
```

For a list of valid values for the `status` field see [response_eval](/momentum/3/3-api/hooks-apn-response-eval).

To use this struct, include the file `modules/mobility/apn/apn.h`.
