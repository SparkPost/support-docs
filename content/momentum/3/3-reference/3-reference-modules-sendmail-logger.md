Momentum supports logging in the same style as the Open Source MTA Sendmail (http://www.sendmail.org). This is mainly of use to sites which are moving from a Sendmail install or otherwise have log-processing software that reads data in Sendmail-compliant format.

### <a name="idp21196368"></a> Configuration

The sendmail_logger module writes to two logfiles: a mainlog where receptions, deliveries, and delivery failures are logged, and a paniclog where errors are logged. These are configured as in the following stanza:

<a name="example.sendmail_logger.3"></a> 


```
sendmail_logger "sendmail_logger1" {
  mainlog  = "/var/log/sendmail/mainlog"
  paniclog = "/var/log/sendmail/paniclog"
}
```
