## Name

ec_get_message_code â€” Returns the current SMTP status code for a message

## Synopsis

`ec_get_message_code`

<a name="idp29608832"></a> 
## Description

`ec_get_message_code` returns the current SMTP code and description associated with a message. The code reflects the status of the message from the point of view of the mail system. It has the form of an SMTP response; a three-digit response code followed by a (possibly multiline) textual description, terminated with canonical line endings (CRLF).

If Momentum were to construct an out-of-band bounce message, this code is used as the reason.

In the following script, the codes are checked on each message and logged.

```
$log = ec_get_message_code;
ec_log $log;
```
