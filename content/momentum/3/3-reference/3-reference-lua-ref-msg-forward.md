## Description

Forward the current message to recipients other than the original recipients. A new message is created and the original message is attached to it. The parameters are as follows:

*   `sender` the address of the forwarder

*   `rcptto` the addresses where the message is to be forwarded to. If there are more than one address, separate them with `,`.

*   `text` brief text. If it contains non-ASCII or non-printable ASCII, charset must be specified.

*   `subject` optional subject line. If it contains non-ASCII or non-printable ASCII, encode it according to RFC 2047.

*   `charset` the character encoding of text. It need not be specified if text contains only ASCII.

Enable this function with the statement `require('msys.extended.message');`.
