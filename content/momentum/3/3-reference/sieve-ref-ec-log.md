if envelope :domain :is "from" "good-guy.com" {
  ec_log "got mail from the good guys";
}
```

### Note

This function cannot log messages longer than `1972` characters. Longer messages are truncated. If your requirements exceed this maximum use [ec_log_file](/momentum/3/3-reference/sieve-ref-ec-log-file) instead.
