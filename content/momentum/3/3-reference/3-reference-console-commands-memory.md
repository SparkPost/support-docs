## Description

The **memory** command provides a detailed overview of the type, count and size of the various memory objects that Momentum uses internally. Sample output is displayed below:

The output of this command can be used to diagnose memory growth issues as well as to help determine whether custom modules are leaking memory. The output consists of three parts: memory usage of objects whose size is fixed, memory usage of objects whose size is not fixed and RSS (resident set size).

### Note

This feature is available starting from Momentum 3.0.17\. Output in XML format using the **xml memory**        command is available as of version 3.1.

The **memory** command can also be issued passing a memory type as an argument. Valid memory types are those listed under the "memory type" column. For example, to view the memory used by Sieve, issue the command, **`memory sieve`**       .

The column names used in the first part for fixed-size objects are:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>memory type</dt>

<dd>

The name of active objects. Any values shown in this column are valid memory types when the memory command is issued with a parameter.

</dd>

<dt>buf size</dt>

<dd>

The size of a memory type.

</dd>

<dt>active objects</dt>

<dd>

Number of active objects for a memory type.

</dd>

<dt>peak objects</dt>

<dd>

Peak number of active objects ever used for a memory type.

</dd>

<dt>allocd objects</dt>

<dd>

Number of objects pre-allocated for a memory type.

</dd>

<dt>current bytes</dt>

<dd>

Total memory allocated for a memory type.

</dd>

</dl>

Additional column names used for objects whose allocations are not of fixed size are:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>peak bytes</dt>

<dd>

The peak bytes ever allocated to a memory type.

</dd>

<dt>mmap count/peak/current %</dt>

<dd>

Percentage of memory allocations that were satisfied using mmap, when system allocators are in use.

</dd>

</dl>

The System RSS represents the current resident set size as seen by the underlying operating system. Note that Momentum tracks its own RSS which can grow and shrink based on usage. On most Unix systems, memory is appropriated by extending a programs heap space using the sbrk() call and as such will never decrease in size.
