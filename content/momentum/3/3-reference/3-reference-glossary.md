</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-bounce"></a> Bounce</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A bounce is a Delivery Status Notification message that informs the sender of a problem with an email message or simply a message which is rejected by the receiving MTA. Bounces can occur for a number of reasons including poor sender reputation, spam filtering, invalid recipient, inactive account, etc. Messages can be bounced during delivery or after delivery through the use of DSN messages. A bounce that occurs during delivery is an in-band bounce and one that occurs after delivery is an out-of-band bounce. See also [Hard Bounce](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-glossary#gloss-hard-bounce) and [Soft Bounce](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-glossary#gloss-soft-bounce).

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-c14n"></a> Canonicalization (C14N)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Within the context of email delivery, canonicalization describes the process of completing Mail-From addresses. Usually this takes the form of adding a domain name to a username to create a legitimate email address. "C14N" is used as a short form because there are 14 letters between the initial 'C' and the final 'N'. Within Momentum you can canonicalize bounce reasons using the **ec_rt_stats** `-c` option. In this case the bounce reasons are normalized for the purpose of aggregation. In version 3.0 the **ec_rt_stats2** command automatically normalizes bounce reasons.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-fbl"></a> Feedback Loop (FBL)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

Feedback loop services are offered by many ISPs. Providers like Yahoo and others offer this service to qualified senders. The ISP sends a notification email to the sender every time that one of their users clicks on a “This is Spam” or “Report Abuse” type button. Qualified senders are required to maintain specific receiving addresses such as `abuse@domain.com`. Feedback loops are handled by the Momentum fbl module.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-fcrdns"></a> Forward Confirmed Reverse DNS (FCrDNS)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

FCrDNS is a technique for matching a domain name against an IP address and then checking that IP address against the domain name. If the IP address returned resolves to the same domain name then the forward-reverse lookup is confirmed. FCrDNS can be used to perform a weak verification useful for creating a white list. See also [Pointer Records](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-glossary#gloss-ptr).

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-fqdn"></a> Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

A domain name that specifies the exact location of a device in the Domain Name System, one that uniquely identifies the host. When identifying nodes in the `mbus.conf` file you must not use the FQDN but the hostname, `node-1` rather than `node-1.lan`, for example.

<dt><a name="gloss-ipv4"></a> Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

The most widely deployed protocol on the Internet. IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal notation are written in the following way `192.168.0.1`. IPv6 uses a much larger address and is the designated successor to IPv4.

</dd>

<dt><a name="gloss-ip-warmup"></a> IP Warmup</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

The concept behind "IP Warmup" is that new IPs need to build a reputation with ISPs. For example, if you send 100,000 emails from a newly acquired IP address that has no history, most large ISPs will block email from this address. IP Warmup slowly increases the send rate on new IPs so that ISPs have time to gauge customer feedback. If there are minimal spam/abuse reports then the ISP will allow an increased send rate.

Sometimes an IP with a good reputation will accidentally send bad content and damage its own reputation. In such cases, it may be necessary to re-establish a good reputation by temporarily suspending sending, reducing the send rate, or by "re-warming" the IP address. With Momentum 3.0 this is achieved using the adaptive module. The adaptive module automatically sets any new bindings to "zero days old" and then slowly increase the send rate unless it starts seeing negative feedback. Should this happen, the adaptive module then throttles or temporarily suspends the IP address according to internal rules. For more information about the adaptive module see [“adaptive – Adaptive Delivery”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-modules-adaptive).

<dt>XCLIENT</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

XCLIENT allows information regarding the original sending host (such as the connecting IP address) to be communicated with the next hop and is useful when Momentum is deployed as a gateway device in a configuration where the internal hosts will benefit from knowing the original connecting IP address.

<dt><a name="gloss-dk"></a> Yahoo! Domain Keys (DK)</dt>

<dd class="glossdef">

An authentication mechanism where a public key is placed in a sender's DNS record. A matching private key on the server is used to sign each message sent, with the signature placed in the message's headers. When an ISP receives the message it checks the signature against the public key to ensure that the message came from the domain in question.
