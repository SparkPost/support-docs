In version 3.0, most module-specific system console commands have changed. How commands are issued depends upon whether a module is a singleton or not. Use the **module list**      command from the system console to determine whether a module is a singleton or refer to [“All Modules”](/momentum/3/3-reference/modules-summary#modules.summary.all.modules). This command also displays the instance name of a module—this information is also necessary when issuing console commands. Find below partial output of the **module list**      command:

```
...
Module: statp:statp
  Scope_Name: statp
  Instance_Name: statp
  Enabled: enabled
  API: Generic
  Name: stats_producer.c
  Description: Stats producer module
Module: ds_core
  Scope_Name: ds_core
  Enabled: enabled
  API: Singleton
  Name: ds_core.c
  Description: generic datasource module
...
```

This output shows both a singleton and a non-singleton module. The instance name of a module is the name that you choose when the module is created. Non-singleton module commands are issued using `Scope_Name:Instance_Name` followed by the command. For example, when you have an ec_logger module named `ec_logger1`, issue the `help` command in the following way:

`05:47:04 /tmp/2025> ec_logger:ec_logger1 help`

Singleton module commands are executed exactly as they were in version 2.2, using the module scope name followed by the command.

As of version 3.0, all module-specific commands related to setting or getting module options have been removed. Use the following syntax to set or get module-specific options: **config [set | eval | get] Scope_Name [Instance_Name] option [value]** . Note that there is no ‘`:`’ between the Scope_Name and the Instance_Name. For example, when you have a sieve module named `sieve1`, you can set the `cache_life` option from the system console in the following way:

`05:47:04 /tmp/2025> config set sieve sieve1 cache_life 300`
### <a name="modules.console.debugging"></a> Setting Module-Level Debugging from the System Console

In version 2.2 it was possible to set and get module-level debugging from the system console in the following way: **debug module *`module_name`* [level]** .

In version 3.0, you set and get module-level debugging using the **config** command. The debug level is set in the same way as any other module option. For example, use the following syntax to set the debug level of an ec_logger module with the name `ec_logger1`:

`05:47:04 /tmp/2025> config set ec_logger ec_logger1 Debug_Level DEBUG`

For a list of all the debug levels see [Table 9.28, “Debug levels”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-debug-flags#conf.ref.debug.levels).
