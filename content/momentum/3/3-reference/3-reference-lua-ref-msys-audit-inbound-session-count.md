## Description

This function counts connections currently established from the specified cidr to the specified service. `cidr` is of the form:

*   `/24` evaluates to connecting IP/24

*   `/32` evaluates exactly to the connecting IP

*   `addr/mask` evaluates to a specific address and mask

*   `addr` evaluates to a specific address

Available service names include:

*   `SMTP`

*   `ECStream`

*   `Control`

*   `ECmmove2` (the service that handles duravip message moves, only available when clustering is enabled)

*   `ECCluster` (only available when clustering is enabled)

*   `inbound_cidr` (only available when clustering is enabled)

This method is equivalent to the Sieve function, [audit_service](/momentum/3/3-reference/sieve-ref-audit-service).

**As of version 3.4, this feature supports IPv6.**

IPv6 addresses are much more flexible than IPv4 addresses in terms of their formatting options. They also use a different delimiter character than IPv4 addresses (a colon instead of a period). This means that in certain contexts, an IPv6 address can create parsing ambiguities.

The accepted convention is to require that, in circumstances where a configuration parameter can also contain something other than an IP address, that an IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets. In practical terms, this means that things like the `gateway`, `routes` and `listen` options must have IPv6 addresses enclosed in brackets. Others, such as `peer`, `relay_hosts` and `prohibited_hosts` do not require the IPv6 address in brackets.

Enable this function with the statement `require('msys.audit');`.
