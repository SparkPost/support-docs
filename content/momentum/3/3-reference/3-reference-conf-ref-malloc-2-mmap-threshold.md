## Name

malloc2mmap_threshold â€” use mmap when allocations exceed this amount

## Synopsis

`malloc2mmap_threshold = 4092`

<a name="idp10070208"></a> 
## Description

When set to a positive value, Momentum will use `mmap` to fulfill memory allocation requirements exeeding the `malloc2mmap_threshold` size, rather than allocating memory from the heap via `malloc` .

Lowering this setting can reduce heap fragmentation and the system RSS, but can use up more address space than heap allocations alone, since the minimum granularity of `mmap` is the system page size.

The default for this option is 4092.

## Scope

malloc2mmap_threshold is valid in the global scope.
