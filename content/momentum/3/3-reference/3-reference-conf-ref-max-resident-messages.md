## Name

max_resident_messages â€” threshold above which messages are not held in memory

## Synopsis

`Max_Resident_Messages = 32768`

<a name="idp10235856"></a> 
## Description

`max_resident_messages` is used to control the maximum number of messages held concurrently in memory. A value of 0 sets no limit. A rough guide to setting this option is to divide the maximum amount of RAM that you want to reserve for messages by your growbuf_size. For more information about the `growbuf_size` option see [growbuf_size](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-growbuf-size).

The default value for `max_resident_messages` is `32768`. However, this default value is typically overridden in the `ecelerity.conf` file and set to `65536`.

### Warning

This is an advanced option. Setting this option to small non-zero values can have deleterious effects on performance. Thorough testing is recommended prior to deployment in a production environment.
