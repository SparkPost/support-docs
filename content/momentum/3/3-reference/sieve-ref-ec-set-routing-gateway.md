## Name

ec_set_routing_gateway â€” dynamically change the gateway based on recipient

## Synopsis

`ec_set_routing_gateway` { *`address`* }

<a name="idp30520944"></a> 
## Description

This action sets the gateway for the message in much the same way as the [gateway](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-gateway) configuration option; the message will be queued to the domain specified by the gateway. A gateway set with this action will override a possible Gateway configuration setting that would otherwise be applicable to the message. See also [routes](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-routes) for domain-wide routing. The headers and the body of the message will not be changed.

The required *`address`* parameter can be either a dotted literal IP address, a hostname that resolves to an A record, or a domain name which resolves to one or more MX records.

Sieve scripts using `ec_set_routing_gateway` should be called in the each_rcpt_phase only.

<a name="example.ec_set_routing_gateway"></a> 


```
if envelope :domain :is "to" "do-set_routing_gateway.com" {
  ec_set_routing_gateway "foo.com";
  }
```

### Note

In order to prevent I/O on the scheduler, when using `ec_set_routing_gateway`, the [keep_message_dicts_in_memory](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-keep-message-dicts-in-memory) option should be set to true.

### Warning

The sievelib module must be loaded explicitly in your configuration for correct operation of `ec_set_routing_gateway`.
