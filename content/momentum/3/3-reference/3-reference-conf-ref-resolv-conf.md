## Configuration Options

Momentum supports one option above what `resolv.conf(5)` supports, as well as a subset of the standard options. The list below constitutes all of the options that Momentum's library supports; details of the standard options can be found in the man page for `resolv.conf`.

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>`nameserver 1.2.3.4` , `search domain1.tld domain2.tld` , `domain localdomain.tld` , `sortlist 1.2.3.4/255.255.252.0`</dt>

<dd>

Identical to the resolv.conf(5) usage.

</dd>

<dt>`lookup bf`</dt>

<dd>

Determines the order in which nameserver lookups are done. The default order is DNS then /etc/hosts, and corresponds to the string `bf`. You can reverse that order by using `lookup fb`.

</dd>

<dt>`options ndots:1` , `options timeout:5` , `options attempts:2`</dt>

<dd>

Identical to the resolv.conf(5) usage.
