## Name

ec_action â€” set SMTP status code

## Synopsis

`ec_action` { *`smtp-code`* } { *`reason`* } [ *`counter`* ]

<a name="idp29138368"></a> 
## Description

This action will issue the provided SMTP code and reason to the remote MTA. Multi-line reasons may be provided; each line will be prefixed with the SMTP code for you automatically.

The optional counter string is used to count the number of hits for this particular action; if omitted, the script filename and line number will be assumed. You can see the hit count via the web console or via **ec_console** using the **sieve stats**       command.

<a name="example.ec_action"></a> 


```
require "ec_action";
if envelope :domain :is "from" "bad-guy.com" {
  ec_action 550 "5.7.1 We don't want mail from %{spfv1:p}";
}
```

```
REMOTE > MAIL FROM:<assailant@bad-guy.com>
LOCAL > 550 5.7.1 We don't want mail from mta01-ft.bad-guy.com
```

This is a terminal action; no further Sieve rules will be run for the current message in the current phase.
