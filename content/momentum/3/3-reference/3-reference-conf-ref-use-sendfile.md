## Name

Use_SendFile â€” use sendfile() when sending mail

## Synopsis

`Use_SendFile = false`

`Use_SendFile = true`

<a name="idp12402432"></a> 
## Description

When set to true, Momentum will attempt to use `sendfile` ), (or other system dependent equivalent) to efficiently send mail to a remote MTA. This typically means that the system will either pull data directly from disk using a form of memory mapped IO, or use a zero copy mechanism to reduce the number of user-space to kernel mode transitions and memory bus overhead that would otherwise be required to push the data through the system.

The default for this option is `false`. This option should be set dependent on the performance and stability of `sendfile` on your system. Unix systems typically also require that `Use_MMAP` also be enabled for this to take effect.
