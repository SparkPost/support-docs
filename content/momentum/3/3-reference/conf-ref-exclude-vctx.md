## Name

exclude_vctx_mess, exclude_vctx_conn â€” Exclude validation context keys from being journaled in the spool metadata.

## Synopsis

`Exclude_VCTX_Mess = ("regex$" "otherregex")`
`Exclude_VCTX_Conn = ("regex$" "otherregex")`

<a name="idp9537056"></a> 
## Description

With more advanced policy configurations, the aggregate size of the validation context data retained in memory may become significant, especially if `keep_message_dicts_in_memory` is enabled.

Both `Exclude_VCTX_Mess` and `Exclude_VCTX_Conn` allow you to specify a list of one or more Perl compatible regular expressions. During swap out, the keys to the message and connection dictionaries are compared against the patterns listed by the `Exclude_VCTX_Mess` and `Exclude_VCTX_Conn` respectively. If a key matches, then that data value will be deleted from the respective dictionary.

Note that keys that have special significance to the core product (these typically have a `#` prefix) can not be filtered by this module.

```
# filters all keys ending in _string from the per-message context
Exclude_VCTX_Mess = ( "_string$" )
```
<a name="idp9544112"></a> 
## Scope

Exclude_VCTX_Mess and Exclude_VCTX_Conn are valid in the global, binding, binding_group and domain scopes.
