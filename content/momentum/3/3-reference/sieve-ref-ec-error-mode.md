## Description

**ec_error_mode** affects how Sieve handles certain kinds of errors (for instance, passing incorrect parameters to Sieve functions, failed includes, low memory conditions). The default is to `fail` the incoming session with a transient error response, but you may set it to `continue` to have the script continue executing past the failure point.

The ability to change this behavior was introduced in 2.2, and the default was changed to `fail`. In prior releases, the default was effectively `continue` and this could not be altered.
