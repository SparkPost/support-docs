## Name

thread_pool_stats â€” Obtain information about thread pools

## Synopsis

`thread_pool_stats` { *`poolname`* } [ *`jobname`* ]

<a name="idp31292384"></a> 
## Description

`thread_pool_stats` takes a thread pool name as its first argument and returns a hash containing various information about the pool, including the number of threads in the pool, queue size, and number of invocations.

If the optional `jobname` is also specified, the queue size and the number of running instances for that specific job in the pool is also returned.

### Note

The list of thread pools can be obtained on the console using the `threads stats` command.

The returned hash contains these keys and associated values:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>poolname</dt>

<dd>

The name of the pool (e.g. "CPU", "IO", "SWAPIN", etc).

</dd>

<dt>queue_sz</dt>

<dd>

The queue size (number of jobs pending for this thread pool).

</dd>

<dt>invocations</dt>

<dd>

The number of jobs that have been handled by this thread pool.

</dd>

<dt>job_num_queued</dt>

<dd>

The queue size for the specific job described in `jobname`. This will be present only if the `jobname` argument was given.

</dd>

<dt>job_num_running</dt>

<dd>

The number of running instances of the specific job described in `jobname`. This will be present only if the `jobname` argument was given.

</dd>

</dl>
