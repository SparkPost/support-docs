## Name

tls_verify â€” specify how to handle the remote presented certificate

## Synopsis

`tls_verify = "no"`

<a name="idp12165712"></a> 
## Description

If TLS is set to `required` or `ifavailable` and TLS is negotiated with the remote mail exchange, this option will specify how the remote presented certificate should be handled. If this option is set to `no`, then no checking of the certificate will be performed. Given the number of self-signed certificates used on mail hosts, this setting is probably the most useful. If this setting is `ca`, then the connection will only proceed if the certificate presented is signed by a valid certificate authority listed in the CA list specified by TLS_CA. If this setting is `host`, then in addition to requiring that the certificate be signed by a valid certificate authority, the common name presented in the certificate must either exactly match the domain or mail exchange to which we are connected.

### Note

For custom behavior create a C module that uses the outbound_smtp_tls_verify_callback and inbound_smtp_tls_verify_callback hooks. For more information see [outbound_smtp_tls_verify_callback](/momentum/3/3-api/hooks-core-outbound-smtp-tls-verify-callback) and [inbound_smtp_tls_verify_callback](/momentum/3/3-api/hooks-core-inbound-smtp-tls-verify-callback).

The default value is `no`.
