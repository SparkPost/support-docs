## Synopsis

<a name="idp15755904"></a> 
## Description

The **count** counts open connections grouped by IP addresses. It needs two arguments. The first argument specifies the type of the connection. It could be `outbound`, `outbound/binding-name` for outbound connections over all bindings or outbound connections of a specified binding respectively. It could also be a connection type to count inbound connections, for example "SMTP". The second argument is an IP address, a CIDR IP address, a CIDR mask or a range of CIDR mask separated by "-", for example, 8-32\. Number of connections will be shown grouped by the IP addresses. CIDR masks give you flexibility to choose the level of granularity of the report.
