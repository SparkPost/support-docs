## Name

local_changes_only â€” whether there is a file for writing local configuration changes

## Synopsis

`Local_Changes_Only = true`

<a name="idp10000192"></a> 
## Description

The `Local_Changes_Only` option defaults to 'false'. If it is 'true', the `Local_Changes_File` option must be defined and all changes are saved to the `Local_Changes_File`. If it is 'false', changes are distributed as described below:

*   When replacing a value that has previously been set, if the file it was last set in is writable then the change is made in-place; the new option value replaces the old option value at the same location in the writable file.

*   If replacing a value that was last set in a read-only file or setting a value that was not set previously, then the change will go to the lexically first writable file in which the scope instance containing the change was defined.
