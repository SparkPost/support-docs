## Name

use_iflist_cache — Whether or not to cache the list of network interfaces configured by the system

## Synopsis

`use_iflist_cache = 0`

<a name="idp12353504"></a> 
## Description

This option determines whether or not to use cached information about the state of the network interfaces; namely which ones are in use and their state.

The default value for this option is `0`. When this option is off and DuraVIP™ is in use, Momentum must traverse the entire list of interfaces. Enable this option if you are using a large number of DuraVIP™s.

Changing the value of this options at runtime requires restarting the ecelerity process–issuing the ec_console command **config reload**        will not suffice.
