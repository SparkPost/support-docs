## Name

ec_forward â€” forward a message

## Synopsis

`ec_forward` { *`sender_address`* } { *`recipient_address`* } { *`text`* } [ *`subject`* ] [ *`counter`* ]

<a name="idp29549600"></a> 
## Description

This action will create a new message with the supplied *`sender_address`* and *`recipient_address`* on the envelope, and will use the supplied *`text`* for the body of the new message.

If the optional *`subject`* is provided, the new message will use that for the `Subject:` header, otherwise Momentum will take the subject of the original message and prefix it with the text "Fwd:".

The message to be forwarded will be attached as an rfc2822/message attachment, complete with all header information.

If multiple recipient addresses are supplied as a stringlist instead of a single string, each recipient will receive a message created in the above manner. This has the same effects as calling `ec_forward` multiple times with a single recipient address.

The optional *`counter`* parameter to `ec_forward` is used to count the number of hits for this particular action; if omitted, the script filename and line number will be assumed. You can see the hit count via the web console or via **ec_console** using the **sieve stats**       command.

Sieve scripts using `ec_forward` can be used in any phase after and including data_phase1.
