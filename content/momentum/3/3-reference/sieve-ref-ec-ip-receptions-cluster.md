## Name

ec_ip_receptions_cluster — Audit how many receptions an IP address has made cluster-wide

## Synopsis

`ec_ip_receptions_cluster` { *`time_series_index`* } [ *`mask`* ]
`ec_ip_receptions_cluster` { *`$hash`* }

## Description

`ec_ip_receptions_cluster` returns a string containing the number of receptions that have occurred for a CIDR block within a configured time window. The referenced CIDR block is constructed by applying the `mask` option value to the SMTP connection's remote IP address. There are two forms of this command.

In the first form, the `time_series_index` value selects a monitor corresponding to its position in the inbound_audit configuration stanza (A `time_series_index` of '0' corresponds to the first monitor in the inbound_audit configuration stanza). The audit data returned for this monitor is based on a weighted sliding average of the current time window within this monitor and the previous time window, thus smoothing the transition between windows. If `mask` is not specified, the default value of '32' is used to compute the CIDR block.

In the second form, a hash is used to pass the arguments. These keys are supported:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>monitor</dt>

<dd>

A string matching a monitor definition within the inbound_audit configuration stanza, for example, "300,6". By default the first monitor listed in the configuration stanza is used.

</dd>

<dt>period_start</dt>

<dd>

Starting window number. The default is 0, which is the chronologically current window. For example, if the inbound_audit configuration stanza defines a monitor as "300,6", then the monitor contains six windows numbered 0 (current) through 5 (oldest). Each time window in this example is 300 seconds duration.

</dd>

<dt>period_end</dt>

<dd>

Ending window number. It defaults to the value of `period_start`. If this key is specified, its value is a window number (which should be equal to or greater than period_start). The result will be an aggregate sum over the window range.

</dd>

<dt>mask</dt>

<dd>

This is the mask used to compute CIDR block. The mask defaults to '32'.

</dd>

</dl>

This feature also requires the cluster module. The cluster configuration stanza must specify metrics replication including the parameter `reception`:

```
cluster {
  # ... other cluster config ...
  Replicate = "inbound_cidr" {}
}
```

This feature also requires the inbound_audit module. See [“inbound_audit – Inbound traffic analytics”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-modules-inbound-audit) for more information.
