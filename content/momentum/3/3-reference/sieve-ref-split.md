## Description

`split` uses its first argument as a delimiter to explode a given string into a stringlist.

For example, to split an IP address into its component octets, we might do something like this:

<a name="example.split"></a> 


```
($a, $b, $c, $d) = split "." "%{spfv1:i}";

ec_log "the IP address is ${a}.${b}.${c}.${d}";
```
