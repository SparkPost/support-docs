You can test your installation by using telnet to connect to port 25 on a cluster node. However, the [swaks](http://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/) tool provides an easier way to test your installation.

### Note

Message Systems does not provide support for the use of any third party tools that we include or reference by name within our product or product documentation; support is the sole responsibility of the third party provider.

Assuming that the user `admin` is configured to receive email at `example.org`, you can send a test message in the following way. Log in to a node, then go to the command line and issue the command:

`shell> swaks -t admin@example.org -f root@centos32 -s localhost`

Doing this sends an email to `admin@example.org` through the mail server on localhost. The received message should be similar to the following:

```

In this example, for the sake of clarity, the server is specified using the `-s` option. If Momentum is hosted on the local machine this option is not required. However, if you wish to connect to an MTA from a remote computer you must ensure that relaying is configured correctly and that swaks is available on the remote computer.
