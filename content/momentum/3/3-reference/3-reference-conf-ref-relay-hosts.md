## Name

relay_hosts — configure the list of hosts for which Momentum relays mail

## Synopsis

`Relay_Hosts = ( "10.0.0.1" )`

## Description

Momentum is a powerful mail delivery system. As an operator, you can expose your system to abuse by allowing unauthorized machines to send e-mail to domains for which the local instance does not provide mail service. Doing so makes your system an "open relay."

When configured to be an outbound e-mail relay, only trusted machines should be allowed to connect and inject messages. This is controlled by the `Relay_Hosts` option. This option takes a space-separated list of network blocks in CIDR form. CIDR form consists of an IPv4 address followed by a number between 0 and 32 dictating the number of bits in the network portion of the address, as opposed to the host portion.

For example, all addresses in the `loopback` space begin with 127\. The netmask on a loopback device is 255.0.0.0 which sets 8 network bits with the remaining 24 bits used for host addresses within the network. Therefore, the CIDR form of the loopback network is 127.0.0.0/8\. For a class C network (256 IP addresses, 254 hosts), the netmask is 255.255.255.0, which means 24 network bits. The CIDR form of the IP block representing addresses 192.168.10.0 through 192.168.10.255 is 192.168.10.0/24. Single hosts have netmask with all (32) bits set making a host address 10.1.2.3 have a CIDR form 10.1.2.3/32.

### Note

Any hosts specified by this option are not subject to any SMTP authentication that you may have implemented. For more information see [“Authentication, Authorization and Accounting”](/momentum/3/3-reference/conf-aaa).

The `relay_hosts` option has no effect on restricting access to an HTTP_Listener.

If your private network (10.10.10.0/24) contains machines that you trust and you wish to also enable relaying from the local host, the following `Relay_Hosts` directive would be reasonable:

`Relay_Hosts = ( "127.0.0.0/8" "10.10.10.0/24" )`

Use the same syntax for IPv6 addresses:

`Relay_Hosts = ("127.0.0.1/32" "::1" "10.79.0.0/16" "fd82:7796:815b:af9d::")`

In version 3.0, `Relay_Hosts` is valid in the Peer scope but using Open_Relay is more succinct.

```
ESMTP_Listener {
  Peer "10.0.0.0/24" {
    # general options for this netblock here
    # use Open_Relay here instead of Relay_Hosts
    Open_Relay = true
  }
  Listen ":25" {
    Peer "10.0.0.1" {
        # options for 10.0.0.1 here
        SMTP_Extensions = ( "ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES" "AUTH LOGIN" )
    }
  }
}
```

## Scope

Note that as of version 3.0, the Relay_Hosts option in the global scope follows the same semantics as the rest of the configuration options; if you specify it in both the global scope and in a listener, the listener setting overrides the global setting. In 2.2 and earlier, the two were merged together.

`relay_hosts` is valid in the global, ESMTP_Listener, listen, pathway_group and pathway scopes. While it is valid in the Peer scope, generally speaking, you wouldn't use it in this scope. Use Open_Relay instead.
