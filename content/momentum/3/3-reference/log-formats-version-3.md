This section documents the log formats used in Momentum version 3.0 and higher.

### <a name="log_formats.mainlog3"></a> The `mainlog.ec` Format

The `mainlog.ec` file logs reception, delivery, transient failure, permanent failure and heartbeat events. The log entry format differs depending upon the event type. The different formats are described in the following sections.

**<a name="idp31581536"></a> E.1.1.1. Reception Records**

Every reception that Momentum performs is written to the `mainlog.ec` file as a single line as shown in the example below.

```
1064868656@00/00-25004-31B987F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@R »
@bob@example.fict@info@postalengine.com@10.0.1.1@201@esmtp@default@default
```

As with all log file entries, the fields are delimited by `@` signs. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.reception.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064868656 | The date of reception in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. This also corresponds with its location on disk. |
| 2 | 00/00-03736-F4101B54 | The batch ID |
| 3 | 00/00-04532-A3456B54 | The connection ID |
| 4 | R | ‘`R`’ indicates a reception. |
| 5 | bob | The localpart of the recipient. |
| 6 | example.fict | The domain of the recipient. |
| 7 | info | The localpart of the envelope sender. |
| 8 | postalengine.com | The domain of the envelope sender. |
| 9 | 10.0.1.1 | The IP address the message was received from. |
| 10 | 201 | The size of the message in bytes. |
| 11 | esmtp | The protocol the message was received over (either esmtp or ecstream). If the message was transferred from another node, the "protocol" will be `xfer`. The value `internal` indicates an internally generated bounce or a message generated by Sieve. |
| 12 | default | The MultiVIP® binding group that the message was assigned to. |
| 13 | default | The MultiVIP® binding that the message was assigned to. |

**<a name="idp31616416"></a> E.1.1.2. Delivery Records**

A delivery line is written to `mainlog.ec` for every message that is delivered by Momentum. In a cluster configuration, transfers between nodes are also logged.

The log entry is an `@` delimited string such as the following:

```
1064871280@20/00-25593-945A87F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@D@ »
postalengine.com@266@group-a@binding-a@0@0.393@10.0.0.1
```

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.delivery.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064871280 | The date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 20/00-25593-945A87F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. |
| 2 | 00/00-03736-F4101B54 | The batch ID |
| 3 | 00/00-04532-A3456B54 | The connection ID |
| 4 | D | ‘`D`’ marks this line as a successful delivery. In a cluster configuration, transfers between nodes are indicated by an ‘`X`’. ‘`X`’ entries appear in the delivery log on the transferring node indicating that the message left for another cluster node. The node receiving the message will have an ‘`R`’ entry in its log and the "protocol" of the message will be `xfer`. |
| 5 | postalengine.com | The destination domain. |
| 6 | 266 | The size in bytes of the delivered message. |
| 7 | group-a | The MultiVIP® binding group for this message. |
| 8 | binding-a | The MultiVIP® binding for this message. |
| 9 | 0 | The number of times the message has been retried. Since this was the initial attempt, the value is 0. |
| 10 | 0.393 | The amount of time, in seconds, between reception and delivery. |
| 11 | 10.0.0.1 | The IP address that accepted the message. |

**<a name="idp31649120"></a> E.1.1.3. Transient Failure Records**

A transient failure is a failure which allows retry of the same message. The ec_logger module allows for optional logging of transient failures.

A transient failure line is an `@` delimited string like the following:

```
1064869327@00/00-25593-CBD987F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@T@ »
example.fict@0@group-a@binding-a@15@0@18.53@10.0.0.1@421 no adequate servers
```

A description of the fields follows:

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064869327 | The date of transient failure in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. This also corresponds with its location on disk. |
| 2 | 00/00-03736-F4101B54 | The batch ID |
| 3 | 00/00-04532-A3456B54 | The connection ID |
| 4 | T | ‘`T`’ marks this log line as a transient failure. |
| 5 | example.fict | The destination domain. |
| 6 | 0 | The number of bytes of data transferred before the failure occurred. Since no connection could be made for bob@example.fict (it's a bogus domain), 0 bytes where transferred. |
| 7 | group-a | The MultiVIP® binding group for this message. |
| 8 | binding-a | The MultiVIP® binding for this message. |
| 9 | 15 | The stage of the message. Stage descriptions can be found at [“Connection Stages”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-log-formats-connection-stages). |
| 10 | 0 | The number of times the message has been retried. Since this was the initial attempt, the value is 0. |
| 11 | 18.53 | The amount of time, in seconds, between reception and this transient failure. |
| 12 | 10.0.0.1 | The IP address of the server which rejected the message. |
| 13 | 421 no adequate servers | The error message associated with the failure. |

**<a name="idp31683776"></a> E.1.1.4. Permanent Failure Records**

A permanent failure indicates that the message that was attempted failed in such a way that it should not be retried further. After logging a permanent failure the message will be discarded.

A permanent failure line is an '@' delimited string like the following:

```
1064870847@10/00-25593-393A87F3@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@P@ »
postalengine.com@31@group-a@binding-a@5@1@3.89@10.0.0.1@552 No such account
```

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.permanent.failure.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064870847 | The date of permanent failure in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 10/00-25593-393A87F3 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. This also corresponds with its location on disk. |
| 2 | 00/00-03736-F4101B54 | The batch ID |
| 3 | 00/00-04532-A3456B54 | The connection ID |
| 4 | P | ‘`P`’ marks the log line as a permanent failure. |
| 5 | postalengine.com | The destination domain. |

| 7 | group-a | The MultiVIP® binding group for this message. |
| 8 | binding-a | The MultiVIP® binding for this message. |
| 9 | 5 | The stage of the message. Stage descriptions can be found at [“Connection Stages”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-log-formats-connection-stages). |
| 10 | 1 | The number of times the message has been retried. |
| 11 | 3.89 | The amount of time, in seconds, between reception and the time of permanent failure. |
| 12 | 10.0.0.1 | The IP address of the server that rejected the message. |
| 13 | 552 No such account | The error message returned from the remote host. |

**<a name="log_formats.mainlog.heartbeat3"></a> E.1.1.5. Heartbeat Records**

A heartbeat is written periodically to the log, to indicate that Momentum is still active and may log further data. The heartbeats are used by the web console for real-time reporting.

`1251470342@@@@M1`

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.heartbeat.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1191248269 | The date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 |   | Unused. |
| 2 |   | Unused. |
| 3 |   | Unused. |
| 4 | M1 | ‘`M1`’ marks this line as a heartbeat. Having a different `type` identifier in version 3.x, helps differentiate log entries. This is useful when a log has both version 2.2 and version 3.x entries. |

Having three unused fields ensures that, like other logs, the fifth field is the log entry type. This makes parsing easier.

### <a name="log_formats.rejectlog.ec3"></a> The rejectlog.ec Format

This section documents the rejectlog.ec format. Every rejection that Momentum performs is written to the `rejectlog.ec` file as a single line as shown in the following example:

```
1236672125: R="10.79.25.142:42601" L="10.79.25.142:25" C="18/00-07149-D7E16B94" PATH="default" »
PATH_GRP="default" P="awaiting mailfrom" E=550 M=scriptlet »
CTXCONN=[pathway=default,ehlo_string="EHLO rh52-node1",ehlo_domain=rh52-node1] »
CTXMESS=[mailfrom_domain=,mailfrom_string="MAIL FROM:<>",mailfrom_localpart=] relaying denied
```

In this case, the fields are delimited by spaces. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.rejectlog.ec.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1236672125: | The date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | R="10.79.25.142:42601" | Remote IP:port |
| 2 | L="10.79.25.142:25" | Local IP:port |
| 3 | C="18/00-07149-D7E16B94" | Connection ID |
| 4 | PATH="default" | Pathway |
| 5 | PATH_GRP="default" | Pathway Group |
| 6 | P="awaiting mailfrom" | Phase |
| 7 | E=550 | Error Code |
| 8 | M=scriptlet | Last Module run |
| 9 | CTXCONN=[pathway=default,ehlo_string="EHLO rh52-node1",ehlo_domain=rh52-node1] | Validation Context for connection |
| 10 | CTXMESS=[mailfrom_domain=,mailfrom_string="MAIL FROM:<>",mailfrom_localpart=] | Validation Context for message |
| 11 | relaying denied | Error message |

The `rejectlog.ec` file also has heartbeat entries in the following format:

`1252064908: Marker 1`

The "Marker 1" entry follows the Unix timestamp and is separated from it by a space.

### <a name="log_formats.acctlog3"></a> The `acctlog.ec` Format

The `acctlog.ec` log contains both authentication entries and authorization entries for the SMTP and Control Listeners. For more information on configuring listeners for logging authentication and authorization events see [“Authentication, Authorization and Accounting”](/momentum/3/3-reference/conf-aaa).

**<a name="idp31770992"></a> E.1.3.1. Authentication Records**

If enabled for the listener, authentication events for Unix domain sockets are logged one per line as shown below:

`1160503808@N@/tmp/2025@@ec-user@1`

If enabled for the listener, authentication events for TCP/IP listeners are logged one per line as shown below:

`1160172232@N@*:2025@10.80.116.126:37164@ec_user@1`

The fields are delimited by `@` signs. `@`, `\`, `\n` and other control characters appearing in a field are escaped by adding an `\` before them. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.authentication.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1160172232 | The date of authentication in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | N | ‘`N`’ indicates that this is a log for *authentication*. |
| 2 | *:2025 | The listener endpoint on which the event occurred. |
| 3 | 10.80.116.126:37164 | The IP and port of the peer. For Unix domain connections, this field will be empty. |
| 4 | ec_user | The user name used for the authentication. |
| 5 | 1 | 1 means the authentication is successful. 0 otherwise. |

**<a name="idp31792960"></a> E.1.3.2. Authorization Records**

A line is written to `acctlog.ec` for every authorization event. The line is an `@` delimited string. `@`, `\`, `\n` and other control characters appearing in a field are escaped by adding an `\` before them.

Authorization entries might look like the following:

```
1160503811@Z@/tmp/2025@@ec-user@1@summary@users
1160504707@Z@/tmp/2025@@ec-user@0@shutdown
1160172223@Z@*:2025@10.80.116.126:37162@ec-user@1@summary@users
1160172219@Z@*:2025@10.80.116.126:37162@ec-user@0@shutdown
```

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.authorization.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1160172219 | The date of authorization in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | Z | ‘`Z`’ indicates that this is an *authorization* entry. |
| 2 | /tmp/2025 *or* *:2025 | The listener endpoint on which the event occurred. |
| 3 | 10.80.116.126:37162 | The IP and port of the peer. For Unix domain connections this field will be blank. |
| 4 | ec_user | The user name used for the authentication. |
| 5 | 1 | 1 means the user is authorized to run the command. 0 means the authorization failed. -1 means some error occurred during authorization. |
| 6 | summary | The command that was requested to run. |
| 7 | users | The role that matched during successful authorization. |

### Note

The ‘`T`’ type indicator denotes an authentication timeout and the ‘`?`’ type indicator denotes an unknown acctlog type.

### <a name="operations.import.logs3"></a> The importlog Format

You can record the outcome of a spool import operation (see [spool import](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-console-commands-spool-import)) by configuring a path for the `importlog`. To do this add the following line to the ec_logger module:

```
...
importlog = /var/log/ecelerity/importlog.ec
```

By default no log rotation is performed for the importlog.

The format for the importlog is:

<a name="log_formats.import.log.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064869327 | The date of the event in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's original in-spool message-id. This is a unique value per message. This corresponds with its location in the spool being imported. |
| 2 | I | ‘`I`’ indicates that this log line is an import event. |
| 3 | 00/00-25004-31B987F3 | The message's new in-spool message-id. This is usually the same as the message-id recorded in field 1, but may be altered during import to avoid collisions with existing messages with the same identifier. |
| 4 | 1 | The result indicator. This is a number between 1 and 4 with the following meanings. 1 is complete success, 2 indicates failure during the read of metadata, 3 is failure reading the message from the spool and 4 is failure writing the message into the main Momentum spool. |
| 5 | /var/spool/my-alternative-spool | The base directory containing the spool being imported. |

### <a name="log_formats.bouncelog3"></a> The bounce_logger

bounce_logger writes a single logfile, `bouncelog.ec`, which records both in-band (or protocol-time) and out-of-band bounces. The format was designed to be a concise, machine-parseable, computationally inexpensive and complete format for writing information about every bounce message.

**<a name="bounce_logger.format3"></a> E.1.5.1. The bounce_logger Format**

The `bouncelog.ec` file logs bounces and heartbeats. The log entry format differs depending upon the event type.

**<a name="idp31846624"></a> E.1.5.1.1. Bounce Records**

Every bounce that Momentum witnesses is written to the `bouncelog.ec` file as a single line as show in the example below. (this example has been wrapped for display purposes; it will be a single line in the log file).

```
1064868656@91/6D-07914-E67BC044@00/00-03736-F4101B54@00/00-04532-A3456B54@B@ »
johndoe@example.fict@info@postalengine.com@group-a@binding-a@21@24@1223@10.0.0.1@554 »
 5.4.7 [internal] exceeded max time without delivery
```

As in all ec_logger-formatted entries, the fields are delimited by `@` signs. The fields are:

<a name="log_formats.bounce.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1064868656 | The date of reception in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 | 91/6D-07914-E67BC044 | The message's message-id. This is a unique value per message. This also corresponds with its location on disk. |
| 2 | 00/00-03736-F4101B54 | The batch ID |
| 3 | 00/00-04532-A3456B54 | The connection ID |
| 4 | B | The log type. ‘`B`’ indicates a bounce. If the `log_transient_failures` option is on, transient failures are indicated by ‘`T`’. |
| 5 | johndoe | The localpart of the recipient of the original message. |
| 6 | example.fict | The domain of the recipient. |
| 7 | info | The localpart of the envelope sender. |
| 8 | postalengine.com | The domain of the envelope sender. |
| 9 | group-a | The binding group the bounce email was bound to, if available. |
| 10 | binding-a | The binding the bounce email was bound to, if available. |
| 11 | 21 | The phase the message occurred in. See [“Connection Stages”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-log-formats-connection-stages) for details. |
| 12 | 24 | The classification code for the message. 24 is a Timeout-Before-Delivery error. See [“Bounce Classification Codes”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-bounce-logger-classification-codes) for the full code list. |
| 13 | 1223 | The message size. |
| 14 | 10.0.0.1 | The IP address of the server that bounced the message. |
| 15 | 554 5.4.7 [internal] exceeded max time without delivery | The raw bounce message from the server. |

The bounce logs also have heartbeat entries in the following format:

`1251222268@@@@M1`

A description of the fields follows:

<a name="log_formats.heartbeat.bounce.record.fields3"></a> 


| Offset | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1191248269 | The date of delivery in Unix timestamp format (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970). |
| 1 |   | Unused. |
| 2 |   | Unused. |
| 3 |   | Unused. |
| 4 | M1 | ‘`M1`’ marks this line as a heartbeat. Having a different `type` identifier in version 3.x, helps differentiate log entries. This is useful when a log has both version 2.2 and version 3.x entries. |

Having three unused fields ensures that, like other logs, the fifth field is the log entry type. This makes parsing easier.

**<a name="idp31902880"></a> E.1.5.1.2. Bounce Classification Codes**

The bounce classification codes are identical for all versions of Momentum. For a list of the codes and their meanings see [“Bounce Classification Codes”](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-bounce-logger-classification-codes).
