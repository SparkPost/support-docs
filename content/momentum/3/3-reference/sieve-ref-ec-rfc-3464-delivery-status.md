## Name

ec_rfc3464_delivery_status â€” return a string containing fields for a RFC3464 DSN

## Synopsis

`ec_rfc3464_delivery_status` [ *`hash`* ]

<a name="idp30438272"></a> 
## Description

`ec_rfc3464_delivery_status` returns a string containing fields to populate the report part of a RFC3464 compliant DSN. Each field ends with `\r\n`. Sample output is shown below:

```
Arrival-Date: Tue, 10 Oct 2006 16:17:51 -0400
Reporting-MTA: dns; mx-0-1.example.com

Remote-MTA: dns; mx-s1-1.omniti.com
Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 relay not permitted
Action: failed
Final-Recipient: rfc822; rcpt@omniti.com
Last-Attempt-Date: Tue, 10 Oct 2006 16:38:22 -0400
Status: 5.0.0
```

Here is an example to generate a RFC3464 compliant DSN message when a permanent delivery failure happens. You should turn off `generate_bounces` in the `ecelerity.conf` file to avoid sending an extra bounce message.

To configure this script to run at the `core_log_permanent_failure_v1` hook point, use the following configuration:

```
sieve "sieve1"  {
  hook "core_log_permanent_failure_v1" {
    script = /path/to/script
    async = "true"
  }
}

generate_bounces = false
```
<a name="example.ec_rfc3464_delivery_status"></a> 


```
$failed_addr = envelope :all "to";
$to = envelope :all "from";
$from = "";

# Don't bounce to the null sender.
if ec_test :is $to "" {
  stop;
}

$report = ec_rfc3464_delivery_status;
$boundary = ec_mime_boundary_create;

generate_mail_raw $from $to text:
Return-Path: <>
From: Mail Delivery System <Mailer-Daemon@mail.omniti.com>
To: ${to}
Subject: Mail Delivery Failure
Date: %{rfc822:date}
Content-Type: multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status;
 boundary="${boundary}"

--${boundary}
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This message was created automatically by the mail system (ecelerity).

A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its
recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:
${failed_addr}

--${boundary}
Content-Type: message/delivery-status

${report}
--${boundary}
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Disposition: inline

------ This is a copy of the headers of the original message. ------

%{rfc2822:headers}
--${boundary}--
.
;
```

You can also pass in a hash of headers to ec_rfc3464_delivery_status, adding custom fields or overriding the standard [RFC 3464](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3464.txt) per-message and per-recipient fields. See the following example:

```
$h = hash_create;
hash_set $h "X-Foo" "bar";
$report = ec_rfc3464_delivery_status $h;
...
```

### Note

Strings in Sieve are all UTF-8 encoded. It is recommended that you use `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8` for a `text/plain` part.
