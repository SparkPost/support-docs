The default configuration files provide default values such that there should be very few changes required to start sending mail through the Momentum server. However, there are a few parameters you will almost certainly need to change. They are:

*   [Relay Hosts](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-relay-hosts)

*   [Relay Domains](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-conf-ref-relay-domains)

*   [ESMTP Listeners and Authentication](/momentum/3/3-reference/ecelerity-conf#ecelerity.conf3.esmtp.authentication)

Many other parameters can be modified. There is more information on this topic throughout this manual.
