The `eleven` module implements the spam filter and e-mail categorization service available from [http://www.eleven.de/](http://www.eleven.de/). If you intend to use this module be sure to choose it during installation. For more information see [“Installing Additional Packages”](/momentum/3/3-reference/install-additional-packages).

### Note

As of version 3.2, this module is available on Solaris (AMD64/SPARCV9). Prior to this, it was only available on Linux.

As of verion 3.5, this module is no longer available on Solaris (AMD64/SPARCV9) nor is it available for Red Hat 6.

Momentum version 3.3 uses version `3.2.0` of Eleven eXpurgate.

### <a name="modules.eleven.configuration"></a> Configuration

Find a typical configuration below:

<a name="example.eleven3"></a> 


```
eleven {
  enabled = false
  work_dir = "/var/tmp"
  update_period = 3600
  license = "/usr/local/eleven/etc/client.key"
  enable_antivir = true
  servers = ( "foo.example.com:55555:1" "bar.example.com:12345:2" )
}
```

**Configuration Change. ** This feature is available starting from Momentum 3.1.

The configuration options for the eleven module are as follows:

<dl class="variablelist">

<dt>enable_antivir</dt>

<dd>

This option enables the Avira SAVAPI-based virus detection. *Note*: The minor results `virus` and `outbreak` are only returned if this option is set to `true`. The default value for this option is `false`.

</dd>

<dt>license</dt>

<dd>

The absolute path to the user's license. The default value for this option is `/usr/local/eleven/etc/client.key`.

</dd>

<dt>servers</dt>

<dd>

Use this option to specify additional update servers. Each server is specified as *`host:port:priority`*. The trailing port and priority fields are optional and, if omitted, default to 55555 (the default port for eleven updates) and 5 respectively. Priority decreases as the numerical value increases with `0` being the highest possible priority.

</dd>

<dt>update_period</dt>

<dd>

How often to poll for updates. The default value is `3600` seconds, one hour. If this value is set to `0`, updates are disabled.

</dd>

<dt>work_dir</dt>

<dd>

The location of temporary files created by this module. The default value for this option is `/var/tmp`.

</dd>

</dl>

### <a name="modules.eleven.runtime"></a> Runtime Usage

As with other Validation modules, eleven may be loaded in passive mode which means that inbound messages will not be virus scanned unless you explicitly call a policy script such as [msys.expurgate.scan](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-lua-ref-msys-expurgate-scan) or the `eleven_scan` Sieve action.

In order to enforce policy using scripts, this module must be loaded in passive mode. For more information about loading a module in passive mode see [*Modules*](/momentum/3/3-reference/modules-overview).

**<a name="idp19895616"></a> Lua Functions**

This module makes the Lua function `msys.expurgate.scan` available. For a description of how this function is used see [msys.expurgate.scan](/momentum/3/3-reference/3-reference-lua-ref-msys-expurgate-scan).

**<a name="modules.eleven.sieve"></a> Sieve Usage**

When you have loaded this module in passive mode use the [eleven_scan](/momentum/3/3-reference/sieve-ref-eleven-scan) Sieve action to trigger a scan in the data phase. Otherwise the scan triggers automatically in the data phase.

**<a name="modules.eleven.scores"></a> Scores**

Both Lua and Sieve create a string representation of the major score value. These functions annotate the validation context with the following values:

*   eleven-majorscore – the numeric classification of the scan

*   eleven-minorscore – the numeric minor classification

*   eleven-result – the string representation corresponding to the eleven-majorscore number

*   eleven-result-subtype – the string representation corresponding to the eleven-minorscore number

If an error occurs, `eleven-majorscore` is set to "error" and `eleven-minorscore` holds the error message. The same applies to `eleven-result` and `eleven-result-subtype`; if an error occurs `eleven-result` is set to "error" and `eleven-result-subtype` is set to the error message.

Otherwise, the major score is set to the numeric major classification and the major result is set to a string version of that classification number. Its value will be one of the following:

*   clean

*   suspect

*   spam

*   bulk

*   dangerous

*   unknown

The minor score is set to the numeric minor classification, and the minor result is set to the string representation corresponding to the eleven-minorscore number. Its value will be one of the following:

*   normal

*   empty

*   empty-body

*   almost-empty

*   bounce

*   advertisement

*   porn

*   virus

*   attachment

*   code

*   iframe

*   outbreak

*   url

*   url-count

*   mail-count

*   sender

*Note*: The minor results `virus` and `outbreak` are only returned if the `enable_antivir` option is set to `true`.
