## Ecelerity version 1.2.10.1 released on 2005-02-04
* Fixed race in async unlinks that could cuase spool bodies to not be deleted. Work around for 1.2.10 is `Async_Unlink_Concurrency = 1`. Ecelerity will remove headers with no bodies (an uncommitted message reception), however bodies without headers will be ignored and must be deleted manually.

## Ecelerity version 1.2.10 released on 2005-02-03
* Add Connect_Timeout_To_Delay, for sweeping of domains 'stuck' in the active queue.
* A large number of per-binding statistics enhancements. Run 'domain yahoo.com' for an example.
* new binding-aware console commands binding active $BINDINGNAME $THRESHOLD binding delayed $BINDINGNAME $THRESHOLD binding fail domain $BINDINGNAME $DOMAIN binding flush domain $BINDINGNAME $DOMAIN
* Augment the delivery system to use sendfile(), allows fully asynchronous swapping in of messages not in memory, and incorporates some other related performance enahncements.
* Additional toggleables for even more aggressive memory management in the event of large queue back pressure. Specifically Drop_Body_After_Trans_Fail = X which allows you to drop out the message bodies (from memory) after X transient failures (setting this to 0 is good for domains that experience a high number of transient failures).
* Fix for a moderately critical connection allocation algorithm issue that causes very unaggressive connection allocation in some situations.
* Message_Expiration and Max_Retries as Binding stanza paramters.
* Provides binding visibility for messages through the showqueue and message details commands.
* Adds history and tab completion to ec_console
* Allows greater management of the memory subsystem by the end user via Malloc2MMAP_Threshold = X Which toggles use of anon mmaps over system mallocs past X bytes. This is aimed to reduce heap fragmentation. A suggested value is 4096.
* Supports a configurable backlog and pool for the message unlinker thread via Async_Unlink_Concurrency = X Async_Unlink_Backlog = Y During some testing under XFS (which appears to perform very poorly), we saw very large amounts of backpressure in the unlink queue. This is not good, so this toggleable will cap that.
* Outbound_Throttle now support granularity up to 1 message per minute. (Previously was 1 message per second). Still is expressed as a float (messages/second).
