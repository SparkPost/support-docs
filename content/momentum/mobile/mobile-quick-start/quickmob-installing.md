Installation of Mobile Momentum is identical to the procedure described in the Momentum manual at "[Installation](/momentum/3/3-reference/install-linux)" you just need to answer `yes` when the installer asks the following question:

`Would you like to enable Mobile Momentum (requires additional license)? (y,n)`
### Note

If you are unfamiliar with Message Systems installation instructions you can run the installer with the `--dry-run` option. This will take you through the installation process without installing the application.
