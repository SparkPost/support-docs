## Place the engagement pixel in the HTML of your next email campaign to find out:

* What browser or device they use to open the campaign
* Where in the world they're located when they interact with the campaign

**Navigate to Analytics Tracker and select “New Analytics Campaign”**

**Step 2. Place Tracking Code In Your Email**

- From the pulldown, select your email deployment software (If you don’t see your ESP in the list, select “Other” and input the merge tag that your provider uses to dynamically publish the recipient’s email address into your email content. Example: %%emailaddr%%)
- Copy the tracking code and place it into your HTML and select Done. (If you want to verify the tracking code before deployment select the "Verify Code" button.)
- After you email the campaign, come back to Analytics Tracker and view the results for the campaign.

*Note: Each time one of your subscriber's opens the email containing the pixel, that is one Analytics event. Data will continue to be collected until the expiration date that you defined in the tracking code setup.*

 We've made exporting Analytics campaigns a whole lot easier! You can now schedule an events export for 'daily' or 'weekly' during an active campaign, or 'upon expiration' of the campaign tracking.
