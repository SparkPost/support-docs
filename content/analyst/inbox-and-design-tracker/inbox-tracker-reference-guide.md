* **Outlook SNDS Integration.** If you send on dedicated IPs, you can bring in SNDS data to understand how Outlook is rating you as a sender. Here is a [set of guides](/analyst/inbox-and-design-tracker/microsoft-snds-set-up-and-configuration) on how to to set up your Outlook SNDS account and how to bring that data into Inbox Tracker.

*SNDS renders a spam verdict on email from your IP(s):* 

*Green: up to 10% of the time* 

*Yellow: between 10% and 90% of the time* 

*Red: more than 90% of the time* 

* **Google Postmaster Tools Integration.** Similarly to Outlook SNDS, Google Postmaster allows you to see how Google is rating you as a sender. If you already have a Google Postmaster account, here is a [guide](/analyst/inbox-and-design-tracker/google-postmaster-set-up-and-configuration/) on integrating its data into the platform. If you do not have one configured, refer to [this guide](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6227174?hl=en) from Google to get started.
* **Begin seeding.** In addition to our panel, you can send to a seed list to get better deliverability coverage across your campaigns. Refer to our [seeding guide(s)](/analyst/inbox-and-design-tracker/intelliseed-sending-guide) for guidance on integrating these addresses into your mail streams to increase the amount of campaign-level data.
* **Setting up alerts.** If you want to monitor your deliverability, traps, blocklists, etc. from afar, alerts are a great way to do that. Here is [a guide](/analyst/inbox-and-design-tracker/getting-started-with-alerts) on how to create a base-set of alerts to begin monitoring changes in your set up or performance.

### General Platform Navigation and Daily, Weekly and Monthly Goals

**Daily/Weekly Goals** 

* Review Spam Complaints, Spam Trap Hits, Blocklists and identify problematic campaigns that need further review.
* If your campaigns are time sensitive, review Average Time To Receive in Campaign Tracker to identify any delays from ISP throttling.
* Test variations of each Subject Line in Subject Line Predict prior to deployment to optimize open rates and compare against your industry average. Subscriber engagement impacts deliverability.
* Check your delivery alerts and Reputation Advisor report to stay on top of your deliverability trends.

**Monthly Goals** 

* Monitor your Inactive Rate. The goal is 40% or below inactive. If your inactive rate is above 40%, consider your engagement based segmentation for domains with low inbox placement, a programmatic reactivation series and identify a point at which you will no longer mail an inactive subscriber.
* Periodically include the **[Analytics Tracking Pixel](/analyst/inbox-and-design-tracker/how-to-use-analytics-tracker)** in a campaign to learn more about your subscribers including how much time they spend reading your email, whether they open on desktop or mobile, their preferred device and browser.
* Review **[Subject Line Advisorâ€™s](/analyst/inbox-and-design-tracker/analyze-and-optimize-subject-line-performance)** sentiment analysis to determine which emotions and subject lines are resonating with your audience.
