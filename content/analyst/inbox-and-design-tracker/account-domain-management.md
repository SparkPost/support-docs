 If you need to make changes to the sending domains you are monitoring with Inbox Tracker we make make it easy and secure.

*Note: To manage domains you must have the Account Manager role. If you are not assigned the Account Manager role you will have **View Only** access to review domains that are on the account or in a requested state.* 

### Adding new domains

 If you want to add a sending domain that is not related to any other domains on your account you will need to validate your ownership or control of the domain to ensure access is authorized. ***Note: These actions will require you to work with your network administrator to update DNS records.***

1. **Request the domain.**

2. **Complete Sending Domain validation steps.**

3. **Inbox Tracker automatically monitors the requested domain for DNS validation.**

 Requested domains will be automatically checked every hour for 7 days to allow for time to update the DNS record. Once validated the domain will be added to your account and will be listed under Account Domains.

### Adding Sub-domains for domains already on your account

 If you are adding additional sub-domains for sending domains that are already on your account, you **will not** be required to validate your DNS record, you can simply add the domains. ***Example: If you have boxbe.com on your account, you can add stage.boxbe.com without a DNS validation requirement.***
