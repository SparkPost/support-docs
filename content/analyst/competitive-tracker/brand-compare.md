### General Overview

 A quick glance at some of the most relevant delivery metrics for your selected brands

### Best and Worst Campaigns

**Best campaign** : A selection of the best high volume and segmented campaigns based upon their inbox placement and read rates

**Worst campaign** : A selection of the worst high volume and segmented campaigns based upon the number of recipients who had the opportunity to read the campaign's messages, but did not.

*Note: We use volume when selecting campaigns to ensure we aren't showing very low volume campaigns with 100% read (or 0% reads). We only show campaigns that have min time of 16 hours (and max 24 hours) - to avoid short run campaigns (or super long running ones as well).* 

### Campaign Counts

 The total number of distinct campaigns sent by the brand on the specified days

### Volume

 The total number of projected messages sent by the brand on the specified days

### Message Engagement

**Read** : The percentage of recipients who are reading the brand’s messages

**Read+Delete** : The percentage of recipients who read the brand's messages and subsequently deleted them

**Delete** : The percentage of recipients who deleted the brand's messages without ever reading them

### Sender Metrics

**Sends Per Day** : The average number of distinct campaigns sent by the brand per day

**Most Active Send Day** : The day of the week that the brand sends the majority of its campaigns

**Most Active Send Time** : The time of day that the brand sends the majority of its email campaigns

*Note* : All times are displayed in your own local timezone.

### Subject Word Performance

**Performance Table** : A comparison of the top words used by the specified brand and the comparison brand’s campaigns with those same words

*Note* : Brands that did not use the word in their subject lines will have no data within that particular table cell.

**Word Cloud** : Each brand’s Word Cloud represents the most commonly used words within their subject lines. The larger the word, the more often it was used.

### Website Snapshot

 A snapshot of the brand’s primary homepage every day, which allows you to track how campaigns and a brand’s homepage offers may (or may not) be related

### Sample Creatives

 A sampling of the most recent message creatives for the brand
