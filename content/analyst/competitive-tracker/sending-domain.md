description: What insights can I learn from the Sending Domain page of Competitive Tracker?
---

[**Here is a video going over all the data on the Sending Domain page:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwuBpFFKRfM)

**Other Sending Domains -** This lists the other sending domains of the same brand.

**Top Competing Domains -** This lists the sending domains and companies of the top competitors within the industry.

---


**Inbox Placement -** This graph displays the Inbox Placement and Sending Volume for the selected domain, for the date range specified, grouped by the day of the week.

**Sending Volume -** This graph displays the Average Volume and Read Rate for the selected domain, for the date range specified, grouped by the day of the week.

**Overlap -** This graph displays the Overlap Analysis within the same industry of the selected domain, for the date range specified, grouped by the day of the week.

 Note: To view the overlap for all industries, select the [Overlap Analysis](/analyst/competitive-tracker/overlap-analysis) tab.

**Overall Inbox Placement -** This graph displays the Inbox Placement (Inbox v. Spam) for the selected domain, for the date range specified. The same data is broken out by the “big five” ISPs to the right of the pie chart (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, and the Global ISPs).

**Est. Reach -** This estimation is based on the number of unique user panelists that received a message from this domain during the last full calendar month from the latest sent date. We strive to ensure these estimates are accurate to within +/- 20% of the actual list size.

**Est. Volume -** This estimation is based upon the number of unique user panelists that received a message from this domain during the last full calendar month. While we strive to ensure that these estimates are accurate to within +/- 20% of actual send volumes, there are times where segmentation or sender skews may cause over or under projections.

**Trap Hits -** Spam trap hit rate for the last 30 days when compared to the spam trap hit rate for all tracked sending domains.

 Note: Hitting excessive spam traps is an indicator of poor list hygiene.

 The possible values are:

 Average: Spam trap hits fall within the average range.

 High: Spam trap hits above average.

**Read -** This metric tracks the percentage of subscribers who read a message. The reads in our platform would be equivalent to the message going from bold to unbold in the email client. Pixel tracking is not required.

**Read+Delete -** This metric tracks the percentage of subscribers who read a message and then subsequently deleted that message.

 The one exception is to this is if we found the message read while already in the trash folder. In that case, we will only track a Read+Delete event.

**Deleted -** This metric tracks the percentage of subscribers who deleted a message without having read it. This means that when we scanned the subscribers’ inbox, we count the message unread in the trash folder.

**Parent Company -** Displays the parent company of the specific brand. Our research team manually maintains this affiliation and stays up-to-date with company acquisitions, etc.

**Headquarters -** Displays the physical address of the brand headquarters, which is sometimes the same address as the parent company. This is also manually maintained by our research team.

**Industry -** Displays the industry that the brand is associated with such as “Apparel & Accessories” or “Restaurants, Bars & Food Service” This is also manually maintained by our research team.

 Different brands within the same Company may have different industries. For example, Tide Detergent is associated with “Cleaning Services & Supplies” whereas Pepto Bismol is associated with “Drugs & Vaccines” but they’re both within The Procter & Gamble Co. company.

**ESPs -** Displays the Email Service Providers (ESPs) that the brand’s sending domains are sending from

---

**Latest Campaigns -** Displays the campaigns received by our data sources in the last 30 days, available in both List Mode and Visual Mode

*List Mode* displays the campaign’s Latest Sent date, Subject line, Volume, Inbox Placement, Spam Rate, Read Rate, Read+Deleted Rate, and Deleted Rate. When available, it also displays the campaign’s Target Country, as well as links to the campaign’s Creative, Raw HTML Headers, and Journey Mapping

*Visual Mode* displays the same information, but highlights the creatives for each campaign.

 We redact all identifying features of an email to protect our panelists’ privacy. For example, the person’s name, shipping address, products ordered, etc. will either be replaced with “[REDACTED]” in List Mode or blurred out in Visual Mode.
