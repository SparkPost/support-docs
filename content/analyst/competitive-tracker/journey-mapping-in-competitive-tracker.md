**Journey Mapping allows you to view email campaigns categorized by journey type, including Welcome, Birthday, Purchase, Abandoned Cart, and Shipping.** 
 Dive deeper to view messaging by target region and see how active versus inactive users experience email.
 
 With AI-powered marketing solutions and sophisticated dynamic content ruling email deployment, it’s more difficult than ever to understand a customer’s email journey. From the welcome email to the first purchase, what other messages landed in the inbox and were they opened? How does that experience compare with your competitor’s? That's just the tip of the iceberg.

**What will I learn from Journey Mapping?** 

* Quickly identify top-performing campaigns by type, view the subject line and creative, and see how the message fits into the overall email program as it is received by individual users
* View a user's email journey by brand to see regional differences in messaging or how an individual’s email experience is different when they’ve been active with the brand in the last 3 months or not
* Select a brand and pinpoint a journey type to see how many messages led up to that user’s action, like a purchase for example. How much time passes between purchase events?
* How many messages does an individual subscriber receive in a given day or week from a brand? Is there a clear limit for active and inactive subscribers?
