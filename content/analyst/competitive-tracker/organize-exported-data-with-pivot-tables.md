**In the PivotTable Fields pop-up, customize your Table to suit your data needs.**

 From the "Values" section, drag and drop fields that you want to create as rows in your Pivot table.

 Make sure to adjust the “Values”, like Read Rate and Inbox Placement, to an Average to reflect percentages by clicking the *i*. Further clean up the data by altering title names and removing unnecessary decimal places.

 You can further customize your benchmark reports to include other fields, such as overall volume or inbox placement for specific ISPs, such as Gmail or Yahoo.

 Recommendations:

* For a *Monthly Benchmark* report, we recommend using a 30-day timeframe
* For a *Quarterly Benchmark* report, we recommend a 90-day timeframe

### Targeting + Subject Line Analysis:

 With a targeted advanced search, you can dig into the performance of specific campaigns and analyze subject line performance.

 This example subject line analysis report is looking at the brand Target for campaigns sent to United States recipients over the last 30 days.

 You can customize your subject line analysis reports to include other fields, such as overall volume or inbox placement for specific ISPs, such as Gmail or Yahoo. Other ways to pivot the table could be adding domain as another field in rows, or adding domain as a filter to look at subject lines from specific domains for the brand.

### Sales Prospecting

 Advanced search is an excellent place to create a prospecting list! You can use the filters to search for campaigns that satisfy the criteria in a new client that you are looking for.

 This example sales prospecting report is looking for campaigns sent to United States recipients for the last 30 days, where expected volume is greater than 600k and deliverability is greater than 50% inbox.

 Corresponding Advanced Search:

 To create a Sales Prospecting Report, follow the steps below:

* Select the following fields: brand, overall\_volume, inbox\_placement
* Drag brand from Values to Rows
* Select the *i* for inbox\_placement to change from sum to average

 You can customize your prospecting list by adding different fields you may be interested in. You could add company and sender\_domain as new rows. You could also use ESP in Filters, to see how prospective brands perform on specific ESPs.
