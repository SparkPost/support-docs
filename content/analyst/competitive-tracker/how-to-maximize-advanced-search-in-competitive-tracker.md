## Increase Search Performance

**Grouping** 

* Multiple terms or clauses can be grouped together with parentheses to for sub-queries
* Example: (Free or %) AND Fall

**Boolean operators** 

* \+ Indicates it must be present; - indicates it must not be present
* The + and – only affects the terms to the right of the operator. Example: Fall +Sale
* Familiar operators AND, OR and NOT are also supported. NOT takes precedence over AND. AND takes precedence over OR
