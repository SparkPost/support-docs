Every email marketer should segment their list to establish and nurture a good reputation in the eyes of the mailbox provider! Segmentation can be used both to divide up your list into targeted interest groups, as well as to segment non-engaged subscribers out of your normal sending list.

First, segmenting your list by interest is a great way to send more relevant, personalized email: By sending different content to different segments of your list rather than sending the same content to everyone, you are sure to increase engagement. Here are some ideas:

* Add a field to your signup form to allow people to choose which types of content they are most interested in, and segment by this field
* Segment by location data
* Segment by what product category a person has purchased from

Second, we also advise to segment your non-engaged recipients from your normal engaged contact list. You will then send to that segment less frequently. This way, you can improve the quality and reputation of your main list, without actually removing your non-engaged subscribers completely. Hereâ€™s how to do it: 


Create a segment based on any subscribers who have engaged between 120 and 365 days ago. Put them on a less frequent mailing, i.e.: 
1. If you send daily send to them weekly 
1. If you send weekly send to them monthly.
1. Change their subject to catch their attention.

Subscribers that has never engaged in 365 days or more should be archived. However, one last [re-engagement campaign](/docs/signals/re-engagement-campaign/) may be reasonable.
