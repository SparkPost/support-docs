Imagine this: At first, your marketing list was very engaged with your emails. However, as time went on, you noticed your open & click rates slowly falling, unsubscribes rising, and even a couple of complaints here and there. What happened? 

Even the most relevant audience will get fatigued eventually. If you notice that your list has fallen from “engaged” to “semi-engaged”, then you may need to shake things up with your content to get your audience excited again. We call this a “content refresh.” 

There are lots of ways to refresh your content, without changing it completely; You certainly don’t want to go too far the other way, and send completely unexpected content that your audience does not want!

Here are some ideas:
* Redesign your templates (make sure they’re mobile friendly!) We’ve got some [template design tips](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/anatomy-great-email-template/) to get you started.
* Try different subject lines.
* [Segment your audience](/docs/signals/segmentation) differently


When you’re making these changes, be sure to [A/B test](https://app.sparkpost.com/ab-testing) [(EU)](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/ab-testing) methodically, to figure out the top-performing content for your list.
