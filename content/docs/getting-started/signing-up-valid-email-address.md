When signing up for a SparkPost account, it’s important to us that you use an email address where we’ll be able to reach you. We use your email address to communicate with you about things like:

* Resetting your password in case you lose it
* Issues related to billing and payments
* Changes that may have an impact on your sending
* Feature announcements
* Information and tips that will ensure smooth sending

With that in mind, we restrict the email addresses used to sign up for SparkPost to those we trust are going to be reachable. If you have trouble signing up for a SparkPost account, check that your email is following these rules:

* Use an email for an individual. We want to make sure we’re sending to a human, not a machine, so sam.walker@example.com is preferred over sparkpost-testing@example.com.
* Don’t use a role account. Role accounts are emails that are typically sent to groups and have a generic local part, like info@example.com, admin@example.com, sales@example.com, and similar addresses.
* Make sure the email you provide can actually receive email. This may sound like a no-brainer, but we see enough undeliverable email addresses it’s worth mentioning.

Of course, our automation isn’t perfect and sometimes we incorrectly classify email addresses. If you’re still unable to sign up for a SparkPost account after taking into account all of the criteria, please let us know by [submitting a support ticket](https://www.sparkpost.com/submit-a-ticket).
