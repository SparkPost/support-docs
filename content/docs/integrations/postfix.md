To use SparkPost as an SMTP relay for Postfix, create an API key with the 'Send via SMTP' permission enabled, thenÂ enter the following into your Postfix config file (typically **main.cf**):

```
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes 
smtp_sasl_password_maps = static:SMTP_Injection:<your API key>
relayhost = [smtp.sparkpostmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous 
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
header_size_limit = 4096000
```

Once you've modified your config file per the above, restart your Postfix server and you should be good to go!
