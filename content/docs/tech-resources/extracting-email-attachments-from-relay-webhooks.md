[Relay webhooks](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/relay-webhooks.html) are a way to receive email to your own HTTP endpoints. For each email sent to your [inbound domain](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/inbound-domains.html), SparkPost will call your endpoint with a [JSON request](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/relay-webhooks.html#header-example-payloads) containing the message with headers already parsed out into an array.

Many of our users also need to extract file attachments from the email. Â Here are some outline steps and sample code showing how to receive emails via relay webhooks and extract any attached files.

 ## Prerequisites

 Before receiving email via relay webhook, the following setup steps are required:

1. Register your domain name in the DNS
1. Configure your domain as an inbound domain on your SparkPost account ([details here](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/inbound-domains.html))
1. Prepare a publicly-accessible HTTP endpoint capable of receiving POST requests with JSON-formatted bodies. Sample code for this step is provided below.

## Retrieving Attachments Through Your Relay Webhook

1. Receive POST request from SparkPost relay webhook service
1. Parse email body using MIME library for your chosen language / framework
1. Extract attachments from MIME email structure

## PHP Relay Webhook Attachments Sample Code

```php
<?php
/* Dependencies:
 * - php-mime-mail-parser (https://github.com/php-mime-mail-parser/php-mime-mail-parser)
 * - The mailparse extension  (http://php.net/manual/en/book.mailparse.php)
 */
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$messages = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'));

foreach ($messages as $msg) {
  $emailBody = $msg->msys->relay_message->content->email_rfc822;
  if ($msg->msys->relay_message->content->email_rfc822_is_base64) {
    $emailBody = base64_decode($emailBody);
  }

  // Parse the message, save and list attachments
  $parser = new PhpMimeMailParser\Parser();
  $parser->setText($emailBody);

  $parser->saveAttachments('/somewhere/safe/');

  $attachments = $parser->getAttachments();
  foreach ($attachments as $file) {
    echo('Filename: ' . $file->getFilename() . '
');
  }
}
?>
```
