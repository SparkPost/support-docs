Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. MFA allows you to use an authenticator mobile app such as Google Authenticator or DUO to verify your login. MFA prevents bad actors from accessing an account even if they've acquired the username and password.

* [Recovering Account Access](#recovering-access-to-account)

# Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication
You can enable MFA from your [Profile page](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/profile) ([EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/account/profile)). SparkPost offers both authenticator app and SMS as methods of MFA. Once enabled, the next time you log in to your account, you'll see this extra authentication requested. 

Click on **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication** to start the process.

## Authenticator App
Use your authenticator app to scan the QR code in the pop up window. Enter the one-time code and continue. Be sure to save your recovery code somewhere safe in case you ever lose your device.

## SMS
In the pop up window, click **Use Another Method or Recovery Code**, then click **SMS**. Enter your phone number and continue. You will receive an SMS with a one-time code. Enter this code and continue. Be sure to save your recovery code somewhere safe in case you ever lose your device.

# Recovering Access to Account
In the event that you lose or replace your authentication device, you have a few options to recover access to your account:
* Use your saved recovery code to login, then re-configure your MFA settings.
* If you have lost your recovery code, contact SparkPost support to request that your MFA configuration be reset. Upon your next login, you will be prompted to re-configure your MFA settings.
