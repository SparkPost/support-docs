Free plans even with Add-ons such as a dedicated IP or previous overages are still subject to the same Free plan support changes, which means that case support will end on October 16th 2017. You are still able to contact our Billing team via Billing@sparkpost.com should you have any queries on payments etc. All accounts continue to have have access to our [Support Docs](http://sparkpost.com/docs) for further information.
