The older paid plans no longer offer the ability to add dedicated IPs to your account. If you require dedicated IPs please upgrade to one of our new plans from the [Accounts/Billing page](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/billing).
Please note that new plans from 150K upwards include a dedicated IP, allowing you to add an IP Pool and new IP. You can of course add multiple IPs at 20USD per month in that or other IP Pools you create.
