Sometimes when we communicate with you as a user (e.g. via our [community Slack channel](https://slack.sparkpost.com)), we ask you to identify your account by providing your username, account ID (Customer ID), or account email address. Having this info allows us to help you faster in situations where we don't already have these details about who you are.

**To find this info, [visit your user profile page](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/profile)** ([EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/account/profile)) where you will find yourÂ username, account ID (Customer ID) and acccount email address info, as well as security settings and more.
