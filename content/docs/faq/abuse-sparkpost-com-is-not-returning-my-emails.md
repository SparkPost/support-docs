If you have received an email from abuse@sparkpost.com, and sent your reply but never heard back, it could be because the email wasn't received for some reason. This can sometimes happen if there is a problem with your IP reputation, or if perhaps there are bad links in the email you are referencing to them. If this happens, and you haven't heard back within 48 hours, please click on the link and fill out the Support [form](https://www.sparkpost.com/submit-a-ticket).

Please let our Support team know that you have been trying to reach our Abuse team but haven't received a response, and we will be sure to pass your response to the folks on the Abuse team.
