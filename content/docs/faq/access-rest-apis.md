Q: What URL do I use to access the REST APIs?

A: The REST APIs can be accessed at [https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/](https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/)... - so for example, the Transmissions API can be accessed by POSTing to [https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/transmissions](https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/transmissions) - you'll also need an API Key with appropriate permissions for that API, which can be created [here](https://app.sparkpost.com/#/configuration/credentials).

For more information check out the [API Docs](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/).
