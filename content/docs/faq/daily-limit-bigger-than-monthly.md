You may see that your daily limit is larger than your monthly limit. In this situation the monthly limit takes precedence and you will be allowed to send to your monthly limit in a single day. We leave this daily limit in place so if you upgrade you can use this larger daily limit without the need to make a request.

In this situation the **monthly** limit takes precedence and you will be allowed to send to your monthly limit in a single day. Injections in excess of this monthly limit would be rejected.

Should you wish to send more than this current monthly limit please consider upgrading to one of our larger plans via the [Account/Billing](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/billing) page.
