description: "If your domain’s status is \"Blocked\", it’s generally because your domain is already in use by another SparkPost account, your domain has been previously blocked for sending abusive traffic through our service or another provider, or because one or more of our requirements are not met"

If your domain’s status is "Blocked", it’s generally because your domain is already in use by another SparkPost account, your domain has been previously blocked for sending abusive traffic through our service or another provider, or because one or more of our requirements are not met. 
Please see the [Requirements For Sending and Bounce Domains](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/requirements-for-sending-domains/) page.
