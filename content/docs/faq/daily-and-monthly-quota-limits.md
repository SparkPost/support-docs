Accounts have daily and monthly sending limits that control number of emails you can send within each time period. These limits protect your account from unexpectedly high overage billing.

You can view your current limits on the [Usage](http://app.sparkpost.com/usage)([EU](http://app.eu.sparkpost.com/usage)) page.

## Daily Limits

All new paid accounts start with a daily limit of 1,000 emails. The limit will grow proportional to the account's monthly volume over the first week of the account. Daily limits also grow over the first week after upgrading 

Daily limits are configured to ensure accounts are able to send well over 100% of their paid plan's volume within the month. If you need to send more in one day, you can request an increase to your daily limit from your [Dashboard](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard?supportTicket=true)([EU](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard?supportTicket=true)). All limit requests are reviewed based upon the account's sending performance and history. Free Test accounts are not permitted increase their daily limit.

### Daily Limit Rolling Period

The daily limit controls the number of emails that can be sent during a rolling 24 hour period. For example, let’s say you send 2,000 emails per hour, every hour, starting at 9AM, until you reach your limit that day. The next time you can start to send any messages would be at 9AM the next day. At that time you would be able to send 2,000 messages. Then at 10AM, you would be able to send another 2,000 and so on.

## Monthly Limits and Overages

If you are on any of our currently-offered paid plans, you can exceed your monthly plan volume up to your monthly limit and you will be charged for the additional usage at your plan's overage rate. Free Test accounts are not permitted to go over the monthly plan volume.

## What happens if I exceed my limit?

If you exceed your limit, whether Daily or Monthly, your messages will be rejected by SparkPost (not queued), so please ensure your account has the appropriate limit needed for your sending pattern, or consider splitting your send to accommodate the limits.

## I have just upgraded and my daily limit hasn't changed!

Daily limits can take up to a week to fully update after you upgrade your plan. If your account is new, please start sending within the limit to start warming up your email reputation. If your limit is too low after this period, you can request an increase to your daily limit from your [Dashboard](http://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard)([EU](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard?supportTicket=true)). All limit requests are reviewed based upon your account's sending performance and history with SparkPost.

### I need a bigger daily limit

If you need to send more than 50,000 email a day on average throughout a calendar month, SparkPost requires that you have one or more dedicated IPs and custom bounce and tracking domains set up. Please set these up before requesting a limit rise.

**Note:**  Please follow our [IP Warm up Guide](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/deliverability/ip-warm-up-overview/) to warm up any new IP and correctly establish your sending reputation.
