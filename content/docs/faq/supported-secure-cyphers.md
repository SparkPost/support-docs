To ensure the highest degree of security and stability for our customers, SparkPost will be disabling a number of insecure TLS and stream cipher protocols on or after October 15. These include TLSv1, ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA, RC4-MD5, and RC4-SHA. This change will affect both REST and SMTP injection endpoints.

## How will I know if I'm affected?
To know if your injection software is affected, compare the list of good ciphers below against the documentation for the client software youâ€™re using. If you begin receiving "SSL HANDSHAKE" errors on or after October 15 during message injection, you should immediately update your client software to the most current stable version.

## What can I do to ensure no service interruption?
In most cases, it should be sufficient to upgrade your client software to the most current stable version. You can ensure you won't encounter a service interruption by checking that your client software supports the following protocols:

   TLSv1.1 or higher
   
   Any of the following stream ciphers
   * ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384
   * AES128-GCM-SHA256
   * ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
   * AES256-GCM-SHA384
   * AES256-SHA256
   * ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256
   * AES128-SHA
   * ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA
   * AES128-SHA256
