If you are getting a 'Relaying denied' error while trying to connect to smtp.sparkpostmail.com, it is likely because you are not connecting to our SMTP endpoint using SSL/STARTTLS and AUTH LOGIN. 

Please check that: 

* You are using port 587Â (or port 2525 when connecting from a Google Compute Engine environment)
* That you are connecting using STARTTLS (sometimes labeled SSL)
* That you are using AUTH LOGIN for the credentials (a username of SMTP_Injection and the password being the API key you created)
* And your sending domain must already be set up and listed as 'ready to send' in your Sending Domains dashboard
